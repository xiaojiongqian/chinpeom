      "meaning": "The raging waves of the Yangtze River crash against the cliffs of Kuimen, as Du Fu gazes at the faintly visible stone piles of the Eight Formation Diagram in the water. 'Oh, Chancellor Zhuge...' he sighs, running his fingers over the weathered stele. These timeworn stones, like Zhuge Liang's unfulfilled ambition to conquer the north, stand unyielding despite the river's relentless erosion. What pains him most is how the First Emperor, seeking personal vengeance against Wu, ultimately shattered Shu Han's chance to unify the realm.",
      "allusion": "After the Battle of Yiling in 222 AD, Zhuge Liang arranged eight piles of stones at the Tuogu Platform in Baidi City. 'Your Majesty, behold,' he said to Liu Shan, pointing at the formation, 'these eight arrays can withstand a hundred thousand elite troops.' The young emperor curiously kicked apart one corner, and Zhuge Liang's face darkened immediately: 'If Wu dares to invade, this shall be the battleground!' As he spoke, he picked up the scattered stones and rebuilt the formation, his sweat glistening in the scorching sun as it seeped between the rocks.",
      "background": "The bitter autumn wind cuts through Kuizhou as Du Fu tightens his tattered blue robe. 'Splash—' A wave soaks his cloth shoes, and in a daze, he seems to see a figure with a feathered fan and silk headdress flickering among the stones. Suddenly, he grabs a withered branch and frantically scrawls the characters 'eternal regret' on the sand, only for the waves to wash them away—like the irreversible regrets of history.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Su Shi of the Northern Song Dynasty recorded in his 'Dongpo Zhilin' that local fishermen often retrieved arrowheads inscribed with the character 'Han' from the ruins of the Eight Formation Diagram. On overcast days, some even claimed to hear the clang of weapons and the thunder of war drums. The Qing poet Wang Shizhen went so far as to assert that he witnessed the stone formations shifting with the rise and fall of the river.",

        "Could the Eight Formation Diagram truly trap an army?",
        "Why did Zhuge Liang choose this location for the formation?",

      "meaning": "On New Year's Eve, Cui Tu rode his lean horse through the chaotic snow of the Ba Mountains. 'Crunch—' The horse's hoof sank into a snowdrift. He tightened his tattered cotton robe and muttered at the scattered lights in the distance: 'The candles of this foreign land are colder than the moon of Chang'an.' Suddenly, his servant A-Fu handed him warm wine: 'Master, have a sip to warm yourself.' His hand trembled as he took the wineskin—back home in Chang'an, was his elderly mother stuffing coins into dumplings at this very moment?",
      "allusion": "The poet recalled Du Fu's poem 'New Year's Eve' from a century ago: 'Keeping vigil at the home of A-Rong, pepper plates already adorned with flowers.' Back then, Du Fu, though poor, found warmth in a friend's home. Now, his servant was imitating the customs of Shu, drawing the character for 'year' on the snow with a branch. 'A-Fu, you're missing a stroke in that character.' 'Master, in Shu, this is how we write it—it symbolizes the endless passage of time!' Cui Tu smiled bitterly. So long had he wandered that even the script of his homeland had grown unfamiliar.",
      "background": "In the winter of the first year of the Qianning era, Cui Tu was demoted to the post of Registrar of Bazhou. On the eve of New Year's Eve, he and his servant braved the snow to assume his post. 'Sir, the courier station says the mountain pass is blocked by a blizzard...' 'Press on!' Cui Tu's breath, laced with the scent of wine, formed white puffs in the air. As they rounded a cliff, he suddenly noticed fox tracks circling a withered tree in the snow, resembling the reunion feast table back home in Chang'an. He reined in his horse abruptly and inscribed this poem on the weathered wall of a courier station.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, when Lu You of the Song Dynasty read the line 'a lone candle in a foreign land's spring,' he wrote in his 'Notes from the Old Study': 'Magistrate Cui must have been left-handed; when holding a candle in his right hand, the shadow should fall to the right.' In truth, Tang Dynasty candlesticks were often placed at the center of desks. The patriotic poet likely projected his own nighttime reading habits onto the scene.",

      "meaning": "On the Ba Plateau in late autumn, the wind and rain had just ceased. Poet Ma Dai watched as flocks of wild geese flew south across the twilight. Outside the inn, an old locust tree rustled, shedding yellow leaves, while an oil lamp flickered by the paper window, stretching his shadow long and thin. White dew dripped down the wild grass in the corner, and the sound of a wooden fish echoed from the dilapidated monk's cell next door. Rubbing his old official robe, unchanged for years, he suddenly hurled an inkstone at the wall—this was already his third failure in the imperial examinations.",
      "allusion": "Back when Wang Wei retreated to the Zhongnan Mountains, he once wrote the lines, 'Mountain fruits fall in the rain, insects chirp beneath the lamp.' When Ma Dai heard an old scholar recount this anecdote in a Chang'an tavern, he drunkenly slammed the table and declared, 'At least Vice-Director Wang had his Wangchuan Villa—I can even discern the rhythm in the leaks of a monk's cell!' This outburst drew roaring laughter from the examinees present.",
      "background": "Huddled in the drafty post station, Ma Dai listened to the coughing of the monk next door. Three days earlier, when the results were posted, he had jostled through the crowd at the announcement board, searching for his name over and over until the guard impatiently flung a basin of wash-water his way. Now, staring at the lampwick's sudden flare, he suddenly remembered the cornus pouch his mother had tucked into his luggage when he left home—its fragrance long drowned in sweat.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Ma Dai later wrote of lone geese again in his poem 'Melancholy Gaze at Sunset.' His contemporary poet Xu Hun teased him, 'Master Ma sings of geese only in autumn—does he hold some grudge against wild geese?' This became a famous jest in literary circles at the time.",

      "meaning": "The fierce wind tore at the withered grass, and in the frontier fortress, goose-feather snow began to fall in August. Cen Shen lifted the beaded curtain of the military tent, and snowflakes immediately rushed in, dampening the brocade drapes. Wrapped tightly in his fox fur, he still shivered uncontrollably, hearing the general outside complain that his frozen fingers could no longer draw the bowstring. Suddenly, the wind ceased, and the snow cleared, revealing countless ice-covered trees blossoming like pear blossoms under the moonlight. In the central command tent, a farewell banquet was held for Military Judge Wu, who was returning to the capital. Amidst the strains of the huqin, the red banners outside the camp gate froze into rigid sheets, as the evening snow fell thick and fast over the Tianshan Mountains.",
      "allusion": "In the winter of the 13th year of the Tianbao era, Cen Shen bid farewell to his colleague at the Luntai military camp. On the eve of Military Judge Wu's departure, everyone gathered around the stove, drinking fine grape wine. 'This cursed weather!' the protector muttered, rubbing his frostbitten nose. 'Even the armor can freeze to the flesh!' Suddenly, Cen Shen pointed outside the tent and exclaimed, 'Look!' The snow-laden branches resembled a springtime pear orchard. Military Judge Wu raised his cup and laughed, 'This scene deserves a poem!' Later, the line 'a thousand, ten thousand pear trees blossom' became an unparalleled ode to snow.",
      "background": "Cen Shen gazed at the fading hoofprints in the snow, his brush repeatedly dipping into the inkstone. The sudden blizzard three days prior, the crisp snap of frozen lute strings in the command tent, the red banners frozen into icy sculptures at the camp gate—all flashed before his eyes. 'Has the judge reached the Tianshan pass by now?' he wondered. Suddenly, he flung his brush aside, splattering ink across the snow-covered map like the spilled grape wine from that night.",
      "additional_info": "During the Song Dynasty, the imperial painting academy once tested artists with the theme 'Snow flies in August in the northern frontier.' One painter took an unconventional approach, depicting the half-open camp gate with a frozen flagpole jutting out, the banner stiff as an iron slab slanting into the snow—a perfect illustration of the line 'the wind tugs at the frozen red banner, but it cannot flutter.' This masterpiece won first place.",

      "meaning": "As the setting sun dyed the mountain peaks crimson, Li Shangyin trod upon rustling fallen leaves to reach a thatched cottage in the hills. Pushing open the door, he saw an elderly monk striking a bronze qing, its lingering tones reverberating along the mist-wreathed mountain path. Leaning on his gnarled cane, the monk smiled and said, 'Do these fallen leaves not resemble you and I in the mortal world?' The poet was suddenly enlightened: the vast universe is but a speck of dust—why cling to love and hatred?",
      "allusion": "The verse subtly alludes to the Vimalakirti Sutra's parable of 'a mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru.' When the layman Vimalakirti feigned illness, and Manjusri Bodhisattva came to visit, Vimalakirti accommodated thirty-two thousand lion thrones within his tiny chamber. Astonished, Manjusri exclaimed, to which Vimalakirti replied, 'The Buddha-land knows no bounds; when the mind is vast, so is the universe.' Just as where the old monk's cane lightly taps, fallen leaves transform into bodhi.",
      "background": "In autumn of the fifth year of the Huichang era, Li Shangyin, having completed his mourning period, returned to officialdom only to face political ostracism. As dusk deepened that day, thoughts of his recently deceased wife led him wandering up the mountain. Suddenly, the sound of a qing pierced through the clouds, drawing him to a humble cottage where an elderly monk brewed tea beneath the eaves, steam mingling with the evening glow. The monk handed him a coarse earthen bowl: 'The tides of bureaucracy are fickle—better to drink deep of this pine-scented wind.'",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Li Shangyin later revisited the 'speck of dust' imagery in his poem 'Inscribed on a Monastery Wall.' His contemporary Wen Tingyun once jested, 'Whenever Yishan visits monks, he returns with fine verses—has he stolen Buddha's pouch of wonders?'",

His trembling fingers traced the weathered tombstone, tears falling onto the yellow earth and leaving dark stains. Tattered clouds like shredded cotton hung overhead, while petals suddenly fluttered down through the woods, startling a nightingale into a mournful cry. The poet recalled nights spent debating politics over chess games with Fang Guan, candlelight flickering over their unfinished match—now only this burial mound remained to face his solitary shadow.",
      "allusion": "【Presenting the Sword to Xu】During the Spring and Autumn period, Wu envoy Ji Zha passed through Xu Kingdom. Xu’s ruler admired his sword but never voiced it. Ji Zha silently pledged to gift it. Upon his return, learning of Xu’s death, he hung the blade on a pine branch by the tomb. When questioned, Ji Zha caressed the sword: 'My heart had already promised it. Should death alter one’s vow?' In the cold wind, the sword tassel swayed with falling leaves.",

Startled crows scattered, revealing the 'tea fragrance' was wild chrysanthemums.",

Du Mu's boat drifts beside a riverside tavern when suddenly, from the opposite bank, a delicate melody drifts over—none other than the decadent tune \"Jade Tree and Rear Courtyard Flowers,\" a relic of the fallen dynasty. The courtesans sway their round fans, singing flirtatious lyrics, oblivious to the poet on the shore who grips his oar, watching the shimmering ripples and recalling how this very city once drowned in revelry, just before the chaos of the An Lushan Rebellion.",
      "allusion": "During the Southern Chen Dynasty, as enemy troops pressed upon the capital, Emperor Chen Shubao continued to revel in pleasure with his beloved consort Zhang Lihua in the Jieqi Pavilion. Historical records recount that on that day, as war drums thundered beyond the palace walls, Chen Shubao caressed Zhang Lihua’s hairpin and remarked with a laugh, 'My love, the new melody of \"Backyard Flowers\" you composed stirs the heart far more than those battle drums!' Three months later, the Sui army breached the city. The pleasure-obsessed monarch fled with his consort into a dry well, later mockingly dubbed the 'Rouge Well' by posterity.",
      "background": "Du Mu moored his boat at night during the height of the fierce rivalry between the Niu and Li factions. Gazing at the lantern reflections shimmering on the riverbank, he recalled how earlier that day, the chancellor Li Deyu had furiously denounced urgent reports from the frontier, while eunuchs in a side hall idly battled crickets. A sudden drift of decadent music drew a cold laugh from him. He pulled out his flask and took a fierce swig, ink mingling with spilled wine as it bled across the poetry draft.",
      "additional_info": "In the Song Dynasty, someone noticed that the poems about the Qinhuai River in Du Mu's collection were all stained with wine, leading to the playful remark that 'where the drunken ink flows freely, the misty aura of the Six Dynasties lingers.' By the Ming Dynasty, scholars had even verified that the song performed by the courtesan that night was a refined version of \"Backyard Flowers\"—the original lyrics from the Chen Dynasty were deemed too risqué, so the tavern had discreetly altered the rhymes.",

The insect fluttered its wings and sang loudly, yet no one paid heed—just as he, despite his immense talent, faced a troubled official career. 'You sing all night until dawn, your voice grown hoarse,' he murmured, gently stroking the tree trunk. 'Yet these lush green leaves remain indifferent.' Suddenly, the cicada's song ceased, as if reminding him: 'I, a low-ranking official, drift like duckweed, and my homeland's fields lie long abandoned. But I thank you for your warning cry—we share the same lofty purity!'",
      "allusion": "During the Spring and Autumn period, Duke Jing of Qi once asked Yanzi, 'Why does the cicada sing?' Yanzi replied, 'The cicada dwells high, drinking dew, believing itself noble—unaware of the mantis lurking behind.' As he spoke, he pointed to the treetop, where a mantis raised its sickle-like forelimbs. This scene reminded Li Shangyin of himself: though he upheld purity like the cicada, he too could fall prey to the 'mantis' of court politics.",
      "background": "In the late autumn of 837, Li Shangyin was on night duty at the Secretariat. By candlelight, he heard the mournful chirps of a dying cicada outside the window, reminding him of how, despite passing the imperial exams, he remained a mere ninth-rank collator. As he dipped his brush, ink dripped onto the paper, spreading like his unresolved sorrow. Suddenly, a gust of wind tore open the window paper, scattering withered leaves onto his desk—this brought to mind his family's long-abandoned estate, and his brush spilled forth his pent-up loneliness and indignation.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Li Shangyin often used the word 'jasper' (碧) when writing about cicadas.

Suddenly, he thought of Chang'e in the Moon Palace—was she leaning against the osmanthus tree at this moment, gazing at the sea-like night sky with regret? Having stolen the elixir to ascend to immortality, she had traded it for eternal solitude. Just like himself, who pursued fame only to be entangled in factional strife, now left to face the blue sky and bright moon, night after night yearning for the warmth of the past.",

The hero Houyi shot down nine of them, and the Queen Mother of the West rewarded him with an elixir of immortality. His wife, Chang'e, out of curiosity, stole and consumed it. Instantly, her body grew light as a cloud, and she flew to the Moon Palace holding her jade rabbit. 'My lord!' she cried in panic, reaching out to grasp something, but only catching a wisp of wind. In the Cold Palace, the osmanthus tree that Wu Gang could never cut down rustled softly. 'Had I known...' Chang'e murmured, stroking the jade rabbit, her crystalline tears turning into moonbeams that scattered over the mortal world.",

Outside the window, the last stars were being swallowed by the dawn, much like his fading political ideals. Suddenly, an autumn wind blew open the window, carrying a chilling osmanthus fragrance that made him shiver—how much it resembled the eternal cold Chang'e must feel in the Moon Palace!",

Li Bai wrote, 'The white rabbit pounds the medicine, autumn after spring,' while Du Fu penned, 'Pondering Chang'e's loneliness.'

      "meaning": "In late autumn before Jia Yi's residence, Liu Changqing trod on the rustling dry leaves, his fingertips brushing against the mottled wall bricks. 'Ah, Jia Sheng...' he sighed softly, gazing at the spider weaving its web under the eaves, as if seeing the exiled genius hunched over his desk writing 'Lament for Qu Yuan,' the ink still wet before being scattered by the autumn wind. The slanting sunlight stretched his shadow long and thin, overlapping with Jia Yi's shadow from a century ago—revealing how the sorrow of being betrayed by one's ruler resonates across time.",
      "allusion": "During Emperor Wen of Han's reign, the young Jia Yi stirred the court with his memorial 'On the Accumulation of Wealth,' only to be exiled as Tutor to the Prince of Changsha due to courtiers' jealousy. On the day of his departure, his mentor Wu Gong chased him to Ba Bridge: 'The Xiang River ahead is rife with miasma...' Jia Yi merely smiled, unfastening his jade pendant: 'This student shall go meet Master Qu.' Over three years in Changsha, he often recited 'Li Sao' by the Xiang River. One day, a red carp leaped from the water, prompting him to exclaim: 'Is this the spirit of the Three-Lord Grand Master?' He then cast his elegy into the river, where the waves instantly swallowed the bamboo slips without a trace.",
      "background": "In the fifth year of the Dali era, Changsha was unusually damp and cold. Liu Changqing, newly demoted to Governor of Suizhou, tightened his blue robe. Passing Jia Yi's former residence, he suddenly heard a children's rhyme from the courtyard: 'The Prince of Liang's fall from his horse—a common fate, why waste a life in grief...' He shuddered—wasn't this the very omen of Jia Yi's death from guilt over the prince's accident? Pushing open the creaking wooden gate, he saw half a broken stele slanting among yellow leaves, its character for 'Han' sharp as a sword, while 'Wen' had faded beyond recognition. Suddenly understanding, he poured wine from his flask before the stele.",
      "additional_info": "A thousand-year-old scholar tree once stood before Jia Yi's residence, said to shed leaves whenever a literati inscribed poetry on it. On the day Liu Changqing composed his poem, the ancient tree sprouted new buds in deep autumn, astonishing locals as 'words moving heaven.' Curiously, the tree withered when Han Yu came to mourn, only to revive when Li Shangyin visited, becoming the Tang dynasty's famed 'barometer of literary fortune.'",

        "Why did Jia Yi die of guilt?",
        "What does the red carp in the Xiang River symbolize?",

      "meaning": "In the faint light of dawn, Liu Zongyuan rose and draped on his robe, rinsing his mouth with icy well water as if even his thoughts were cleansed. Holding the yellowed palm-leaf scriptures, he paced to the eastern study. Amidst bamboo shadows and moss traces, the old monk's courtyard was so quiet that the sound of dewdrops falling could be heard. When the morning sun pierced through the mist, he saw dewdrops hanging on the green pines like a freshly bathed gentleman, and suddenly understood: the fleeting fame pursued by the world paled in comparison to the contentment brought by this moment of Zen enlightenment.",
      "allusion": "The 'palm-leaf scriptures' in the poem allude to Xuanzang's pilgrimage for Buddhist texts. During the Zhenguan era, Xuanzang witnessed monks at Nalanda Monastery in India engraving scriptures onto palm leaves with iron styluses, marveling at their divine craftsmanship. He brought back 657 palm-leaf scriptures. While lodging at the Great Wild Goose Pagoda, he once told his disciples, 'These leaves record not just words, but vessels that can ferry people to salvation.' As he spoke, he gently traced the raised engravings on the scriptures, the characters seeming to dance in the candlelight.",
      "background": "In the fifth winter of his exile to Yongzhou, Liu Zongyuan often visited Longxing Temple to listen to Master Chao's lectures. At dawn that day, he walked up the frost-covered stone steps to the temple and saw a young novice sweeping fallen leaves with a bamboo broom, the rustling startling the bronze bells on the eaves. The creaking sound of the old monk pushing open the wooden door of the scripture hall reminded him of the Jingyang Bell tolling for morning court in Chang'an. Suddenly, he realized: this was the true court of the heart.",
      "additional_info": "Song Dynasty literati discovered hidden profundity in this poem: 'drawing well water - reading scriptures - enlightenment' mirrors the three stages of Zen practice.

      "meaning": "The setting sun dyed the cliffs of Red Cliff crimson as the poet Du Mu bent down to pick up a rusted halberd head. As sand grains slipped through his fingers, he seemed to witness the earth-shattering battle from eight hundred years ago—Zhou Yu standing on a warship engulfed in flames, when suddenly the east wind rose, and tongues of fire instantly devoured Cao Cao's fleet. At that moment, the chains of the Bronze Sparrow Tower clinked faintly; had the east wind been delayed but a moment, the silk skirts of the Qiao sisters would have fluttered in Cao Cao's palace instead.",
      "allusion": "In the winter of the 13th year of the Jian'an era, Cao Cao's million-strong army pressed upon the border. As Zhou Yu observed the stars one night, the veteran general Huang Gai burst into his tent: 'Commander, the southeast wind is about to rise!' The next day, Huang Gai feigned surrender, steering twenty fire ships straight into Cao Cao's camp with the abruptly shifting east wind. Amid the flames, Cao Cao stumbled in retreat, his sword plunging into the river and sending up towering splashes. Meanwhile, in Xuchang, craftsmen at the Bronze Sparrow Tower were busy engraving the names of the Qiao sisters onto golden cages meant for captive beauties.",
      "background": "While serving as governor of Huangzhou, Du Mu often wandered alone through the ancient battlefield of Red Cliff. One late spring evening, as he rubbed the fragments of unearthed weapons, he suddenly heard the faint sound of horns carried by the river breeze.

      "additional_info": "When Su Shi of the Song Dynasty visited Red Cliff, a local fisherman unexpectedly dredged up a broken sword inscribed with the character 'Zhou.'

      "meaning": "In late autumn at Choubi Post Station, Li Shangyin paused amidst the rustling fallen leaves. Monkeys and birds in the mountains startled and fled, as if still awed by the stern authority of Zhuge Liang's military commands ('Even now, apes and birds dread his written orders'); the swirling winds and clouds seemed to guard the remnants of ancient barracks ('While wind and clouds keep watch o'er storied walls'). He envisioned Chancellor Zhuge, feather fan in hand, writing by lamplight ('In vain the great commander wielded his divine brush'), only for the scene to shift to the pitiful image of Liu Shan surrendering in a prisoner's cart ('Till at last the conquered king was borne in a captive's car'). The inscription 'Talents equal to Guan Zhong and Yue Yi' still remained on the stone cliff, yet Guan Yu and Zhang Fei had long perished ('With Guan and Zhang dead, what could be done?'). As dusk fell, the poet softly chanted 'The Liangfu Lament,' his eyes reddening with sorrow for this eternal regret of 'falling short of victory despite one's best efforts' ('The Liangfu song sung, his grief was not done').",
      "allusion": "In the sixth year of Jianxing during the Shu Han dynasty, Zhuge Liang convened a military council at Choubi Post Station. 'Report! General Wei Yan proposes the daring Ziwu Valley strategy again!' A guard rushed into the tent with bamboo slips. By flickering candlelight, Zhuge Liang traced his fingers over the map: 'This plan is too risky... If we lose Jieting, Shu will have no defensive stronghold.' Suddenly, a gust of wind flung open the tent flap, scattering the bamboo slips of 'The Liangfu Lament' across the floor. When aide Yang Yi gathered them, he noticed the chancellor's vermilion annotation beside the line 'I paced beyond the gate of Qi'—'When the north is pacified, I shall finish this.' Little did anyone know these would become his eternally unfinished last words.",
      "background": "In winter of the ninth year of Dazhong, Li Shangyin passed through Choubi Post Station in heavy snow. An old soldier pointed at arrow marks on the cliff: 'See? Those are test shots from Zhuge's repeating crossbows!' That night in the posthouse, he suddenly heard metallic clinks outside. Pushing open the window, he saw only moonlit ruins—a weathered stone statue of Zhuge Liang stood amid overgrown grass, its sleeves seeming to flutter in the night wind. The poet was struck by how his own marginalized plight mirrored Zhuge's 'devotion until death' yet tragic failure. Immediately grinding ink, he began writing, staining his blue robe with tears before finishing.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, during the Song dynasty, someone unearthed a broken inkstone at Choubi Post Station inscribed with 'Disinterestedness cultivates clarity of mind.' When Lu You visited, he deliberately used this inkstone to grind ink for his poem 'Riding a donkey through Jianmen in drizzling rain'—whereupon the ink revealed faint patterns resembling Zhuge Liang's 'Memorial on the Expedition.' Later research proved it a late Tang replica, but the legend of 'Zhuge's spirit manifestation' endured for millennia.",

The season is late, and though my heart yearns, sleep eludes me. Reciting my friend's exquisite verses over and over, I scarcely notice the crows heralding the break of dawn. The poem depicts the scene of the poet and his friend Cheng Yan exchanging verses on an autumn night. Through imagery of the empty city, the lone goose, and the pounding sounds, it creates a desolate and chilly autumn night atmosphere, expressing the poet's cherished friendship and mutual admiration.",
      "allusion": "The line 'the pounding sounds of a thousand households at night' alludes to the legend of Meng Jiangnü: During the Qin Dynasty, Meng Jiangnü's husband, Fan Xiliang, was conscripted to build the Great Wall. On an autumn night, Meng Jiangnü pounded clothes under the moonlight, longing for her husband. Moved by her sincerity, neighbors joined in, and the pounding sounds of a thousand households merged into one. That night, the Great Wall suddenly collapsed, revealing Fan Xiliang's remains. Since then, pounding clothes on autumn nights has become a symbol of longing.",

Han Hong recited it repeatedly, recalling how, a year earlier, the two had drunk wine and discussed poetry under an osmanthus tree. Cheng Yan had laughed and said, 'Autumn nights are best for composing couplets.' Suddenly, the cawing of crows snapped him out of his reverie, and he realized dawn had broken, his robe damp with dew.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Han Hong and Li Yi were known as the 'Pounding-Clothes Poets' among the 'Ten Talents of the Dali Era.' Legend has it that the two once wagered on composing poems about autumn nights.

Fingering the jade pendant that had chimed during the morning court assembly, he recalls the exhaustion of retreating through these gates at dusk with imperial edicts in hand. 'Minister Guo...'

With that, Fan Li sailed away. Wen Zhong was later ordered to commit suicide, while Fan Li, under the alias Tao Zhu Gong, roamed free. Reading this historical account during his illness, Wang Wei slapped the table and exclaimed: 'Minister Fan was truly wise!'",

A gentle evening breeze carried the boat into the mouth of the stream, where wildflowers bloomed in abundance. As night deepened, the boat turned into a mountain col in the west, and suddenly, the poet looked up to see the Southern Dipper twinkling beyond the ridges. Mist drifted like gauze over the pool's surface, while the moon's reflection silently retreated toward the stern among the trees.

Fan Li stroked his fishing rod and replied, 'Do you see the fish in this stream? Are they not freer than those in the royal court?' Later, he indeed sailed away with Xi Shi across the Five Lakes, leaving behind the tale of the 'Old Man with a Rod.'",

      "meaning": "On a late winter, early spring morning, the poet Wang Wan stood on a small boat at the foot of Beigu Mountain. The sound of the boatman's oars stirred the thin mist over the river. He gazed at the gradually widening banks—last night's rising tide had brought the water almost level with the shore. In the morning breeze, a lone white sail hung in the azure sky like a feather. Suddenly, a red sun leaped from the horizon, dispelling the last remnants of darkness from the fading night. 'So spring has quietly slipped into the old year!' he mused, touching the letter to his family in Luoyang tucked in his robe. Looking up, he saw a flock of wild geese flying north. 'Wild geese, could you carry this letter home for me?'",
      "allusion": "The poem contains the allusion of 'message tied to a wild goose's foot.' During Emperor Wu of Han's reign, Su Wu was detained by the Xiongnu, who falsely claimed he had died. A Han envoy then declared that the emperor had shot down a wild goose with a silk letter tied to its foot, stating Su Wu was alive in a marsh. The Xiongnu chieftain, shocked, had no choice but to release Su Wu. As Wang Wan watched the geese flying north, the image of Su Wu herding sheep with his envoy's staff seemed to appear before him. He whispered to the geese, 'If nineteen years could be endured, surely my letter will find its way home?'",
      "background": "On a cold night in the early Kaiyuan era, Wang Wan, en route to Luoyang for the imperial examinations, stayed at an inn in Zhenjiang. Awakened by the sound of the tide at midnight, he pushed open the window and saw the Yangtze River under moonlight, flowing like a ribbon of silver. 'Tomorrow will surely bring fair winds!' he exclaimed, eagerly donning his robe and grinding ink. But then he heard the cries of a child in the neighboring room. Suddenly, he remembered how his own young son had clutched at his sleeve, weeping when he left home. His brush hovered over the paper, a drop of ink spreading across the page—and with it, the homesickness in his heart.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, the chancellor Zhang Yue personally inscribed the lines 'The sun rises from the sea at night's end, spring enters the river in the old year' in the Hall of Government Affairs, urging scholars to emulate their style. Even more remarkable, later generations discovered that these lines subtly aligned with astronomical phenomena—that year, the Beginning of Spring did indeed fall before Lunar New Year's Eve, making 'spring entering the old year' an accurate seasonal record!",
      "questions": [
        "How did Su Wu endure nineteen years?",
        "How were family letters delivered in the Tang Dynasty?",

      "meaning": "The setting sun dyed the paths of Zhongnan Mountain crimson as Pei Di reined in his horse and declared to Cui Jiu: 'On this journey to explore the hidden depths, do not merely skim the surface! Be like Xie Gong, who tread through countless cliffs and valleys in his wooden clogs, and never emulate that Wuling fisherman who merely glanced at the entrance of the Peach Blossom Spring before turning back.' Pointing toward the distant layered peaks, he added, 'See those depths where clouds and mist intertwine? Surely, more breathtaking waterfalls and wondrous pines await you there!' The hooves of his horse kicked up dust, carrying these earnest words into the mountain breeze.",
      "allusion": "During the Taiyuan era of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, a fisherman from Wuling rowed his boat astray into a grove of peach blossoms. Amidst the falling petals, he encountered the people of the Peach Blossom Spring—children with golden hair and elders with flowing white locks. 'Our ancestors fled the chaos of the Qin Dynasty to this secluded haven,' an old man explained, offering freshly brewed peach blossom wine. The fisherman lingered for several days before departing, the admonition 'Do not speak of this to outsiders' still ringing in his ears. Yet, he scattered beans along his path as markers. When the governor sent men to retrace his steps, the radiant peach grove had vanished into the mist, leaving only a stream carrying fallen petals silently eastward.",
      "background": "Outside Chang'an in the third year of the Tianbao era, Pei Di watched his dear friend Cui Jiu's dappled horse ascend the mountain trail. Recalling their midnight conversation in Zhongnan the night before, he remembered the firelight flickering in Cui Jiu's eyes as he spoke of his struggles in officialdom. Suddenly, Pei Di raised his whip and recited these twenty characters, as if seeing Wang Wei strumming his zither at his Wangchuan estate—realizing that both of them, in their own ways, were seeking their own Peach Blossom Spring.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Pei Di's poem was later included in the 'Three Hundred Tang Poems,' becoming a companion piece to Wang Wei's 'Farewell.' During the Qing Dynasty, it was discovered that Zhongnan Mountain indeed had a 'Valley of Depths and Shallows,' its entrance marked by a stone tablet inscribed with the words 'Do not emulate the Wuling fisherman.' This sparked a flurry of poetic tributes from scholars, weaving a delightful tale in literary history.",

He gazed at the waterfowl circling over the sandbar in the river, while withered yellow leaves fluttered down like his own graying hair. The turbid river surged endlessly, mirroring the hardships of his ten years of wandering. The old poet touched his empty wine flask—even drowning his sorrows in drink had become a distant luxury.",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that during his time in Kuizhou, Du Fu often visited a tavern near White Emperor City. One day, the owner noticed his persistent cough and urged, 'Old Du, the newly brewed unfiltered wine warms the body—won’t you have a cup?' But Du Fu shook his head: 'The physician forbids wine... Save it for the young and strong drinkers.' As he spoke, he looked longingly at the young fishermen on the river.",
      "background": "In the late autumn of 767 AD, the ailing Du Fu climbed alone to the high terrace of White Emperor City. The cold wind lifted his patched robe, and in the distance echoed the drumbeats of soldiers drilling. Suddenly, he recalled composing poetry on the heights by Qujiang Pond in Chang’an twenty years prior, with Li Bai by his side. Now, old friends were scattered like stars, leaving only the lonely tap of his bamboo cane against the stone steps.",
      "additional_info": "The phrase 'monkeys’ mournful cries' alludes to a fisherman’s ballad from Badong: 'The Three Gorges of Badong stretch long; three ape cries soak one’s sleeves with tears.' Song dynasty poet Su Dongpo once quipped, 'Old Du’s verse carries the very sound of autumn in every word,' and borrowed its essence in his 'Red Cliff Rhapsody': 'Lamenting the brevity of life, envying the Yangtze’s endless flow.'",

To take in the full grandeur of this thousand-mile vista, we must climb higher—just as in life, we must always strive for greater heights!'",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that Wang Zhihuan, Gao Shi, and Wang Changling were drinking at a pavilion when songstresses took turns singing famous poems of the time. Wang Zhihuan pointed to the most beautiful singer and wagered, 'If she doesn’t sing my poem, I’ll never compete with you two again.'

He immediately took up his brush and penned this timeless masterpiece.",

      "meaning": "In late spring, Li Bai ascended the Phoenix Terrace alone. Gazing at the desolate platform, he seemed to see phoenixes dancing gracefully there in bygone days, now leaving only the Yangtze River flowing endlessly. His fingers traced the weathered stone railings, his feet stepping on the broken bricks of the Wu Palace ruins, when suddenly he kicked half a Jin Dynasty tile—those princes and generals had ultimately turned into a handful of dust in forgotten graves. Raising his eyes, he saw the mist-shrouded Three Mountains, and the Egret Isle splitting the Qinhuai River into two silver ribbons. Suddenly, a drifting cloud obscured the sun, just like the treacherous courtiers blinding the emperor's judgment, making him unable to see the distant Chang'an, the city of his dreams.",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that during the Liu Song Dynasty of the Southern Dynasties, a multicolored phoenix once alighted on this terrace. The scholar Lu Kai was playing chess with a friend when they suddenly heard the phoenix's cry echoing through the heavens. They rushed to the terrace and saw the phoenix, its feathers shimmering, circling the platform three times before flying toward the rising sun. Lu Kai, overwhelmed with excitement, dropped and shattered his teacup: 'This is an auspicious omen! A monument must be erected to commemorate it!' Later, a stone tablet inscribed 'Phoenix Terrace' was indeed erected nearby, attracting countless poets and scholars to pay homage.",
      "background": "In the spring of the sixth year of the Tianbao era, Li Bai, who had been 'granted gold and dismissed' by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, wandered to Jinling. That morning, with the mist still lingering, he climbed the Phoenix Terrace, a wine gourd in hand. Gazing at the remnants of the Six Dynasties, he recalled his experiences in Chang'an three years earlier—the sinister look in Gao Lishi's eyes as he publicly removed Li Bai's boots, the way Consort Yang covered her sleeves to stifle a laugh. He took a fierce swig of wine and suddenly hurled the gourd into the river: 'The Phoenix Terrace is empty, the road to Chang'an is severed—why drink this foul wine any longer!'",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Cui Hao once inscribed a poem on the Yellow Crane Tower that made Li Bai set down his brush in admiration. This time, Li Bai deliberately imitated Cui's poetic structure—the opening couplet, 'On Phoenix Terrace once phoenixes flew,' mirrors Cui's 'The sage on yellow crane was gone away.' Later, Du Fu teased: 'Li Bai, with wine, writes poems by the hundred, on Phoenix Terrace, copying Cui Hao's style,' which became a humorous anecdote in literary circles.",

      "meaning": "Liu Zongyuan stood atop the city tower of Liuzhou as fierce winds lashed raindrops against his robes. He gazed at the lotus flowers in the distant Hibiscus Pond, battered and swaying helplessly, while rainwater streamed down the city walls overgrown with creeping fig vines. 'This rain is like the slander of the court,' he sighed to the elderly servant beside him. Layers of mountains obscured his view toward the four distant prefectures—Zhang, Ting, Feng, and Lian—while the winding Liujiang River mirrored the twists and turns of his troubled thoughts. 'We five exiles sent to Lingnan can hardly even exchange letters anymore.'",
      "allusion": "In ancient times, Qu Yuan, banished to the south of the Yangtze, used 'creeping fig and fragrant orchids' in his poem 'Li Sao' to symbolize nobility and purity. After Liu Zongyuan was demoted to Liuzhou, he deliberately planted creeping fig vines all over his official residence walls. One day during a storm, an aide urged him to take shelter indoors. Stroking the rain-soaked vines, he remarked, 'Qu Yuan once grieved at the sight of creeping fig. Are these rain-drenched vines not like us—loyal ministers cast into exile?'",
      "background": "In the sixth month of the tenth year of the Yuanhe era, shortly after arriving in Liuzhou, Liu Zongyuan encountered a violent storm. Braving the rain, he climbed the city tower and thought of his four close friends—Han Tai, Han Ye, Chen Jian, and Liu Yuxi—who had also been exiled. As the rain blurred his vision, he suddenly seized a brush and wrote between the cracks of the city wall bricks: 'Together we came to the tattooed lands of Baiyue...' Just then, a bolt of lightning struck, and the ink bled under the rain, mirroring their scattered political fates.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, when Liu Yuxi received this poem, he teased in his reply: 'Zihou (Liu Zongyuan's courtesy name), your depiction of the rain is so vivid—do you spend every day drenched in Liuzhou?'

In the distance, the spring waters of the Jin River and the floating clouds over Mount Yulei remained unchanged since ancient times, while the Tang Dynasty, like the temple of Liu Shan, the last ruler of Shu Han, appeared desolate under the setting sun. The old poet couldn't help but pound the railing and sigh: 'The court is as unshakable as the North Star; let not the Tibetan invaders run rampant!' Finally, like Zhuge Liang in his time, he began chanting the 'Liangfu Yin' in the twilight.",
      "allusion": "The poem subtly alludes to the story of Zhuge Liang: after Liu Bei entrusted him with his orphaned son at Baidi City, Zhuge Liang set up a humble thatched cottage outside Chengdu to fulfill his late lord's wishes. There, he pored over the 'Liangfu Yin' day and night, pondering strategies to govern the state. One late autumn evening, a young attendant saw the Prime Minister put down his bamboo scrolls, step into the courtyard, and gaze at the northern stars, murmuring: 'My lord, do you see? The North Star has never shifted its position, just as my loyalty to the Han remains unwavering...' Suddenly, he coughed violently, and his feathered fan fell to the ground, its ribs inscribed with the words 'Conquer the Central Plains.'",

A petal clung to his tattered robe, and the poet smiled bitterly at his companion Yan Wu, saying: 'Look at these flowers, blooming so carelessly...' Before he could finish, a metallic taste rose in his throat.",

Suddenly encountering a woodcutter from his homeland, he abruptly turned away—afraid to hear news of changes at home, as though fearing to shatter the moon reflected beneath thin ice.",
      "allusion": "An old station guard recalled: That winter, the exiled Master Song would carve tally marks on the station walls to count the days. One snowy day, he snatched the courier's bag in search of a family letter, only to find court bulletins inside. The courier sighed: 'The southern miasma is thick; last month another courier fell off a cliff.' Hearing this, Song Zhiwen threw the bamboo strips covered in tally marks into the fire pit.",

      "meaning": "The young Li Bai sailed through the Jingmen Mountains by boat, and suddenly the view opened up before him: the rolling green hills abruptly vanished, transforming into endless plains, while the Yangtze River surged forward like an untamed stallion. As night fell, the moon reflected in the water resembled a bronze mirror soaring through the sky, and the shifting clouds conjured mirages of celestial palaces. The splashing waves at the bow made him suddenly lower his head—this was unmistakably the river water of his homeland! It turned out that the Shu River, from a thousand miles away, had been escorting his journey all along.",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that King Huai of Chu once dreamed of the Goddess of Mount Wu here and ordered the Jingmen Mountains to be carved open at dawn to divert the Yangtze River. As the craftsmen chiseled the stone, an old fisherman warned, 'The mountain is the spine of a dragon; breaking it will anger the water gods!' True enough, floods erupted after the mountain was split, only subsiding when the goddess appeared and threw her jade pendant into the river. When Li Bai passed by, the boatman still pointed at the moon's reflection in the water, saying, 'Look, that’s the glow of the goddess’s jade pendant.'",
      "background": "At 24, Li Bai left Shu for the first time, brimming with excitement like a fledgling eagle freed from its cage. As his boat passed Jingmen, he snatched the boatman’s hat and wore it on his head, shouting to the mountains on either bank, 'I’m off to conquer the world!' Suddenly, the mountain range broke off, and he stood dumbfounded at the vast expanse before him. Pulling out a gourd of wine, he took a fierce swig, then splashed ink across the page as he wrote this poem. As he penned the final line, a droplet—whether river water or a tear—landed with a 'plop' on the character for 'hometown.'",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, 60 years later, Du Fu passed through Jingmen while fleeing turmoil and wrote 'Stars hang over the broad plains' from the same spot.

Maple leaves tremble by the riverbank, and scattered fishing lights flicker, yet they fail to warm the sorrow of his failed imperial examination.

The old boatman, Lao Li, noticing his despondency, handed him warm yellow wine: 'Young master, in my forty years of fishing, I’ve seen twelve scholars fail the exams—all thirteen succeeded the following year!'

With that, he flicked the blade with his finger, producing a dull, resonant hum.",

He fished out the last few copper coins from his pocket, weighed them in his palm, and smiled wryly before writing the line, 'To dispel sorrow, spend thousands in drink.' Just then, a gust of wind blew through the hall, extinguishing the lamp, leaving only the sound of rain pattering on banana leaves in the darkness.",

      "meaning": "On a drizzling spring morning, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and his consort Yang Guifei departed from Penglai Palace in their imperial carriage, winding along the elevated passageway towards Xingqing Palace. Wang Wei, accompanying them, glimpsed through the beaded curtains the Wei River shimmering like a silver ribbon around the Qin region, while Mount Huang's mist enshrouded the ruins of Weiyang Palace. A sudden breeze stirred willow branches to brush against the golden chariot, and turning back, he saw the spring blossoms of Shanglin Garden glowing more vividly in the rain. In the distance, the phoenix towers of Chang'an flickered among clouds, while nearby, raindrops dripped from countless rooftops. Wang Wei murmured: 'His Majesty's journey aligns with the spring season's vitality—this is no ordinary excursion!'",

When Weiyang Palace was later constructed, its walls were deliberately angled to harmonize with the mountain's contours. Now, as Wang Wei gazed at Mount Huang's misty ruins, he almost heard the debates of long-dead craftsmen: 'Master Architect, must these walls truly slant?' 'By imperial decree, the palace must resonate with the mountain's spirit!'",
      "background": "In spring of 742 AD, Wang Wei was on duty at the Jixian Academy. That dawn, an urgent summons arrived. Hastily shielding himself with an umbrella, he rushed to Penglai Palace, his official robes splattered with mud.

As the carriage reached the passageway's highest point, the consort suddenly cried out through the rain: 'Sanlang, look!' Following her finger, Wang Wei beheld Chang'an like an ink-wash painting—and inspiration flooded his mind.",

Cen Shen tightened his official robe as he walked along the Vermilion Bird Avenue, hearing the intertwined calls of the dawn-rooster and orioles.

The morning stars had yet to fade, and dew-laden willow branches lightly brushed against the banners of the imperial guards.

One day, his colleague Zhang Hua deliberately fed fish by the pond and teased, 'Would you care to try the coarse grains of commoners, Lord Xun?' Xun Xu flushed crimson with embarrassment. Since then, 'Phoenix Pond' became a metaphor for the Zhongshu Sheng (Secretariat). Jia Zhi held office there, and Cen Shen’s poem deliberately highlighted his esteemed position.",

      "additional_info": "At the time, the four great poets competed on the same theme, though Jia Zhi’s original poem has been lost to history. Interestingly, later critics deemed Cen Shen’s work the best embodiment of the 'flourishing Tang spirit,' while Wang Wei’s leaned toward elegance.

      "meaning": "As dusk enveloped the land, Zhang Jiuling lay alone on a stone couch in the depths of a bamboo grove, the rustling leaves seeming to wash away his sorrows. Watching a solitary wild goose skim the treetops, he suddenly sat up: 'Oh soaring bird, carry my earnest heart to Chang'an!' But then he shook his head with a bitter smile—for the court was like birds and fish, each in their own realm; who could understand this loyal heart of mine?",
      "allusion": "The phrase 'a high-flying bird conveying feelings' alludes to the legend of wild geese carrying messages. During Emperor Wu of Han's reign, Su Wu, trapped herding sheep by the North Sea, tied a silk letter to the foot of a southbound goose. When hunters in Chang'an's Shanglin Park shot it down, the emperor wept upon recognizing the handwriting: 'This is surely Minister Su's script!' and immediately sent troops to retrieve the loyal official. Zhang Jiuling, then marginalized by Li Linfu, longed for such a goose to deliver his loyalty straight to Emperor Xuanzong's desk.",
      "background": "In autumn of the 24th year of the Kaiyuan era, Zhang Jiuling, as chancellor, repeatedly admonished Emperor Xuanzong against appointing Li Linfu, only to be alienated. That night, restless at his Zhongnan Mountain estate, he paced alone through bamboo groves, his linen scarf damp with dew. Suddenly seizing a brush, he angrily scrawled on bamboo slips by moonlight—the ink even staining three falling bamboo leaves black.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Zhang Jiuling later adopted the habit of sending messages by birds. When lychees arrived from his southern hometown, he would place two fresh fruits in bamboo-tube letters for carrier pigeons to deliver to the emperor. Until his demotion to Jingzhou, a lychee pit covered in peck marks still sat on Xuanzong's desk.",

      "meaning": "In the winter of Jiangnan, old farmer Wang pointed to the orange grove and said to his grandson, 'Look at these crimson oranges, still verdant in the icy snow. It’s not because the earth is warm—it’s because they have the spirit to withstand the cold in their bones!' The little grandson, rubbing his frost-reddened nose, asked, 'Then why does no one praise the orange trees?' Old Wang sighed, 'They grow deep in the mountains, and their goodness never reaches the noblemen. Just like your father’s talents, trapped in these valleys... But remember, gold will always shine. Like these orange trees, someday someone will appreciate their shade.'",
      "allusion": "In his poem 'Ode to the Orange Tree,' Qu Yuan wrote, 'Under heaven’s canopy, the glorious orange tree thrives.' There’s a story behind this. That year, exiled to Jiangnan, Qu Yuan was faint with hunger when an old fisherman pressed two frozen oranges into his hands. With tears in his eyes, Qu Yuan asked, 'Why can the orange tree endure winter without withering?' The fisherman laughed heartily, 'You’ve got the question backward! You should ask the other trees—why can the orange tree do it, but you cannot?' Later, the orange tree’s 'unyielding independence' in 'Ode to the Orange Tree' became Qu Yuan’s own symbol.",
      "background": "The winter Zhang Jiuling was demoted to Jingzhou’s governorship, he saw a peddler hawking oranges in the snow outside his office. He bought a basket and noticed each stem still bore a green leaf. A servant muttered, 'Not as charming as peaches or plums.' Zhang Jiuling suddenly smashed his teacup: 'Peaches and plums wither at spring’s end, but these oranges have weathered storms!' That night, he wrote poetry by candlelight, his pen piercing the paper—like his beleaguered career—yet the ink still bled through with force.",
      "additional_info": "Later, when Emperor Xuanzong of Tang tasted the tribute oranges from Jingzhou, he recalled Zhang Jiuling’s poem and deliberately placed the oranges among peaches and plums, saying, 'Jiuling is my crimson orange.'

      "meaning": "On a late autumn morning, a solitary swan flew in from the vast sea, its feathers still damp with briny seawater. It skimmed low over the moat outside Chang'an but dared not alight—'How could this murky water be worthy of my wings?' thought the swan. Suddenly, it spotted two kingfishers building a nest on a Three-Pearl Tree, their resplendent plumage glistening in the sunlight. 'Beware!' the solitary swan couldn't help but cry out, 'Perched so high, aren't you afraid of the hunter's golden pellets?' With that, it flapped its wings and soared deep into the clouds, leaving the kingfishers lost in thought.",
      "allusion": "During the Warring States period, there was a jade craftsman named Bian He in the state of Chu. He discovered an uncut piece of jade in Mount Jing and presented it successively to King Li and King Wu of Chu, but both failed to recognize its value, resulting in Bian He having his feet amputated. Holding the jade, Bian He wept at the foot of Mount Jing for three days until King Wen of Chu ordered the stone to be cut open, revealing the peerless treasure—the He Shi Bi. This story echoes the poem's line, 'Fine attire invites pointing fingers,' illustrating how true treasures often attract envy and calamity.",
      "background": "In the autumn of the 24th year of the Kaiyuan era, Zhang Jiuling was demoted to Jingzhou. That night, as he sat alone in the courtyard, the cry of a wild goose suddenly pierced the night sky. Under the moonlight, he watched a lone goose, separated from its flock, glide past the eaves, and couldn't help but reflect on his own fall from the heights of the chancellorship. 'Am I not this solitary swan?' he mused bitterly, grinding ink as a blot spread across the paper. 'Those petty men now in power at court are just like those kingfishers...'",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, the Three-Pearl Tree is recorded in the 'Classic of Mountains and Seas' as 'a tree resembling a cypress, with leaves like pearls,' and Zhang Jiuling likely borrowed this imagery.

      "allusion": "In Qu Yuan's *Li Sao*, fragrant herbs and beauties often symbolize noblemen. Zhang Jiuling adapts this allusion: in the Chu palace, Qu Yuan stands adorned with orchids. 'Why does the minister alone favor wild blooms?' a maid asks.

Geshu Han polished his treasured blade in his tent when a panicked guard reported: 'The enemy is less than thirty li from Lin Tao!' The general laughed: 'Fetch my purple-gold helmet!'

By dawn, Tibetan scouts found their commander's flag planted atop the Tang arrow tower, fleeing in terror a hundred li overnight.",

In the frost-laden stillness after the snowfall, he hears the predawn drums and horns from the barracks piercing through the Three Gorges, while above, the starry river trembles upon the rippling Yangtze. Suddenly, heart-wrenching wails erupt from the wilderness—\"Surely more widows mourning their fallen men,\" he murmurs. Yet from afar drift the carefree folk songs of fishermen. Amid this night woven of sorrow and joy, a thought strikes him: \"Even legends like Zhuge Liang and Gongsun Shu—where are their mighty deeds now? Mere dust beneath the earth.\"",
      "allusion": "Old Du gazed toward the direction of Baidi City, his mind conjuring the scene from two centuries earlier when Gongsun Shu had declared himself emperor there. At high noon that day, a dragon's roar suddenly echoed through the city, and the garrison soldiers witnessed a white horse leaping skyward from the moat (legend claims Gongsun Shu \"ascended the throne by leaping on horseback\"). At that very moment, Zhuge Liang was playing his zither atop the city tower when a string snapped with a sharp twang. He sighed and said, \"Baidi City's fate is sealed.\" Sure enough, not long after, this city where the \"Crouching Dragon\" (Zhuge Liang) and the \"Leaping Horse\" (Gongsun Shu) once vied for supremacy was ultimately lost to the sands of time.",
      "background": "In the bitter winter of 766 AD, the 54-year-old Du Fu lay restless in the western pavilion of Kuizhou. Though the smoke of the An Lushan Rebellion had dissipated, warlords across the land reignited the flames of war.

Suddenly, a gust of wind flung open the dilapidated window with a clatter, scattering the draft poems on his desk.

After arranging her cloud-like coiffure, she examined herself in the mirror; having changed into silk robes, she added fresh fragrance. From afar, she saw the curtains of the main hall being lifted—palace attendants in robes and trousers were cleaning the imperial bed. It became clear the emperor would not come tonight. Through delicate descriptions of actions, the poem reveals the psychological shift from anticipation to disappointment in the hearts of these secluded palace women.",

One day, a mystic told the emperor, 'If Your Majesty fasts for a hundred days at the Immortal-Viewing Tower, the Queen Mother of the West will surely descend.' Believing this, the emperor ordered palace maids to dress in finery daily in anticipation.

When the mournful melody rang out at the execution ground, even the executioner's blade trembled.

Under the moonlight, its shadow swept lonesomely across the sandbar, as if it might be swallowed by the dark clouds at any moment.

Suddenly, the pipa notes of a Liaodong maiden pierce the air, and the mournful tones of a Qiang flute transform into the 'Marching Beyond the Frontier.' The tears of iron-willed soldiers fall upon the frozen earth more densely than arrows.",
      "allusion": "As veteran Zhao Da polished his armor in the tent, he suddenly heard the familiar tune of 'Breaking the Willow.'

Zhao's voice trembled, 'Twenty years ago, when I left home, my younger sister played this very tune under the willow tree.' The recruit looked up: 'Are you Brother Zhao from Youzhou? Your sister is now the finest pipa player in Liaodong.' The towering man suddenly knelt, letting the snow soak through his battle robe.",

Suddenly, a young scout galloped in, cradling a frozen Hu courtesan: 'She stole intelligence from the enemy camp!' When the woman revived, she seized a Qiang flute and began to play, and the sound drew wails from outside the tent. The poet noticed the tattoo beneath her pipa calluses—it was the mark of Chang'an's imperial music academy! He took up his brush that very night, ink and candle tears staining the silk together.",

She caressed the tulip-embroidered pouch her husband had given her before leaving for war—ten years had passed, yet the conflict in Liaoyang remained unresolved, and all news from the White Wolf River had ceased. In Danfeng City, the water clock dripped endlessly as she sat alone before her loom. Suddenly, the moonlight illuminated half a bolt of amber-hued brocade, as if mocking her solitude.",

Years later, as a renowned general, Han Xin confided to an old friend: 'That kneel showed me the height of the heavens.'",

Suddenly, he slapped the table and laughed: 'People always imitate Xu You washing his ears or Bo Yi eating ferns to feign purity, unaware that mingling in the mundane world is true wisdom!' Pointing at the portraits of Wu Zixu and Qu Yuan on the wall, he shook his head, 'Look at these sages—they achieved greatness but refused to retreat and lost their lives. How inferior to Zhang Han, who longed for perch and water shield in the autumn breeze!' As he spoke, he raised his wine cup, the amber liquid reflecting his slightly reddened eyes.",

He immediately resigned and returned home. On the journey, he excitedly gestured to the boatman: 'Row faster!

As he took a swig from his wineskin, a few drops splashed onto the mottled wall of the post station, resembling the bloody tears of Wu Zixu, who was executed with his eyes left staring at the Wu Gate.

Yet Li Bai suddenly set down his cup, flung aside his chopsticks, and rose abruptly, drawing his sword. Its blade gleamed coldly under the candlelight. He scanned the room, his eyes filled with bewilderment—as if standing at a crossroads in life: wishing to cross the Yellow River, only to find it blocked by ice; intending to ascend the Taihang Mountains, yet the path was buried in snow. In a daze, he saw himself transform into Jiang Shang fishing by the stream, then in a flash, become Yi Yin sailing past the sun.

Indeed, King Wen of Zhou came in person to invite him. Meanwhile, the envoy of King Tang said to Yi Yin: 'You dreamed five times of sailing past the sun—this is the Mandate of Heaven!' Later, Yi Yin helped the Shang dynasty overthrow the Xia, becoming a revered statesman. Li Bai used these allusions to hint at his longing for recognition by a wise ruler.",

Li Bai, dismissed from court with a gift of gold, sat alone in a tavern as the laughter of foreign wine-sellers drifted through the window.

Suddenly, whispers from a neighboring table reached him: 'Li Hanlin is but a court poet.'

The sun had just touched the Immortal's Dew Catching Plate when incense smoke curled around the dragon-embroidered robes. After the morning court session, Imperial Secretary Jia had to hurry back to the Secretariat to draft edicts, his jade pendants tinkling as he walked toward his office by the Phoenix Pool.",

One day, the king deliberately woke him early, but the attendant insisted, 'I have not heard the rooster crow—I dare not report falsely.' Impressed by his loyalty, King Xuan established the 'chicken herald' position specifically for dawn announcements. This detail reflects the Tang court's preservation of ancient rituals.",

In the warm breeze, orioles began to sing, and sunlight illuminated the duckweed, turning it translucent green. The sudden sound of the nostalgic tune nearly brought him to tears.",
      "allusion": "The line 'suddenly hearing a sorrowful song' alludes to a historical anecdote: during the Jin Dynasty, Lu Ji, while serving in Luoyang, heard someone singing the Wu region's 'Song of the Hard Road' and was moved to tears, staining his lapel. At this moment, Wei Yingwu was traveling with his fellow townsman, Minister Lu, when they unexpectedly heard a similar Wu melody. The two exchanged bitter smiles. Minister Lu tapped the boat's railing and said, 'Doesn’t this song sound like the 'Wu Promenade' that Lu Ji once heard in Yecheng?' Wei Yingwu gazed at the duckweed on the river and murmured, 'Even duckweed has roots to cling to.'",

When they stopped to rest at a teahouse, a neighboring songstress abruptly began singing a Wu folk tune. Wei Yingwu’s teacup trembled in his hand—the melody reminded him of the lullabies his mother sang when he was a child. He hastily excused himself and, in solitude, pressed his sleeve to his reddened eyes.",

Pushing open the carved wooden door, she found the vibrant spring scenery locked behind high walls, with even the sunlight tinged with loneliness. Bored, she walked to the center of the courtyard and began counting the crabapple blossoms when suddenly a dragonfly mistook her jade hairpin for a flowering branch and alighted upon it. This momentary misunderstanding unexpectedly brought the frozen spring scene to life.",
      "allusion": "The allusion to the 'jade hairpin' originates from the era of Emperor Wu of Han. When Lady Li, gravely ill, refused to see the emperor, she merely used her jade hairpin to adjust her hair. Upon seeing the hairpin, the emperor felt as though he were seeing her in person, leading later generations to refer to jade hairpins as 'jade-scratching heads.' Liu Yuxi cleverly adapts this allusion: when the dragonfly mistakes the hairpin for a real flower, isn’t the secluded beauty also being mistaken as part of the courtyard’s spring scenery?",
      "background": "While serving as the Crown Prince's Advisor in Luoyang, Liu Yuxi received Bai Juyi’s poem 'Spring Lyrics.'

As he took up his brush, the dragonfly alighting on the maidservant’s hairpin sparked his inspiration—revealing how melancholy could transform into a poetic moment.",

At dawn, soldiers searched with torches for the fletching, only to find the white-feathered arrow deeply embedded in the hard stone ridge!",
      "allusion": "During a patrol along the border, the famed Western Han general Li Guang mistook a boulder for a fierce tiger. The old general, his beard bristling, drew his carved bow to its fullest and shouted, 'Take this, vile beast!' The arrowhead sank three inches into the rock. Upon realizing it was a stone, Li Guang laughed heartily, 'Had I known it was a rock, I would have shot it clean through!' Later attempts saw arrows merely bouncing off.",

      "meaning": "The frontier moon rises over the Tianshan Mountains, casting its cold light through the vast sea of clouds. The howling wind travels thousands of miles, sweeping past the walls of the Yumen Pass. The garrison soldiers gaze at the moonlight, recalling how Emperor Wu of Han was once besieged at Mount Baideng, while the nomadic cavalry still lingers by Qinghai Lake. For centuries, this land of war has witnessed only bleached bones, never the return of the departed. Surely, their wives in high towers now sigh under the same moon.",
      "allusion": "In the seventh year of Emperor Gaozu of Han, Liu Bang led his army in pursuit of the Xiongnu to Mount Baideng, only to be encircled by Modu Chanyu's 400,000 cavalry for seven days. In the blizzard, two or three out of ten Han soldiers lost fingers to frostbite. Chen Ping devised a stratagem: he sent envoys to bribe the Chanyu's consort, warning that Han beauties would soon be sent as tribute. Fearing displacement, the consort persuaded the Chanyu to lift the siege. After escaping, Liu Bang touched his frostbitten ears and told Chen Ping: 'Your single scheme outmatched a hundred thousand troops!'",
      "background": "Li Bai overheard garrison soldiers recounting frontier tales in a Chang'an tavern. Through drunken eyes, he seemed to see the moon over Tianshan's snowy peaks and hear the winds beyond Yumen Pass. Suddenly, he slammed the table, seized a wine jug, and began inscribing poetry on the wall. When the tavern keeper tried to stop him, he laughed: 'Let me write an eternal moon for those soldiers who will never return!'",
      "additional_info": "The Dunhuang Library Cave yielded a Tang-dynasty musical score for 'Moon Over the Mountain Pass'. Scholars discovered that its reconstructed melody extensively employs 'lunzhi' finger-rolling techniques to mimic howling winds and galloping hooves—a musical embodiment of Li Bai's line 'the long wind sweeps ten thousand miles.'",

      "meaning": "On a late autumn night, in a side chamber of the Chang'an imperial palace, a consort clad in apricot-red gauze wept alone. She heard the faint strains of music and song drifting from the front hall, where the emperor was hosting a banquet for his newly favored beauty. The bronze mirror reflected her still-lovely face, yet the jade belt draped over the brocade incense warmer had remained untouched for three months. Thus she leaned against the incense warmer until dawn, as the sandalwood ashes in the burner accumulated half an inch high.",
      "allusion": "During Emperor Xuanzong's reign, Consort Mei Jiang Caiping lived in solitary seclusion at Shangyang Palace after losing favor. One snowy night, hearing the distant notes of the 'Rainbow Skirt, Feathered Dress' melody, she asked her maid: 'Is His Majesty at the Pear Garden?' The maid hesitated before replying: 'It's Lady Yang performing the newly choreographed Whirling Dance.' With a bitter smile, Consort Mei plucked her zither until the string snapped with a 'zheng' at the line 'Willow-leaf eyebrows long unpainted.'",
      "background": "When Bai Juyi served as Left Reminder, he often kept night watch at the palace. Once hearing a night-shift maid singing 'Lament of Changmen Gate,' he learned upon inquiry she attended an exiled talented lady. At dawn, he encountered the emperor with swollen eyes and wine stains on his dragon robe's sleeves. These observations eventually crystallized into the sleepless night depicted in his 'Palace Poem.'",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, when compiling his poetry collection in later years, Bai Juyi drew a small maid's portrait beside this poem. Modern scholars note the handwriting strikingly resembles his 'Pipa Song' line 'At thirteen mastered pipa's art,' possibly hinting both poems' protagonists shared origins among the same courtesan troupe.",

      "meaning": "By the banks of the Huai River in autumn, Wei Yingwu unexpectedly reunited with an old friend from Liangzhou. Holding hands, they gazed at each other, noticing the frost-like white at their temples. The poet reminisced about nights a decade ago along the Jianghan rivers, when they would drink and converse, always supporting each other on their drunken returns. Now, after drifting like floating clouds for ten years, their bond remained as enduring as the Huai's flowing waters. Watching the geese fly northward, he suddenly asked, 'Shall we return home together?' But his friend only smiled and pointed to the autumn mountains: 'Is this scenery not our homeland?'",
      "allusion": "The poem subtly employs the典故 of 'wandering like floating clouds': During the Spring and Autumn period, Confucius, observing a lone cloud drifting, sighed to his disciples, 'That cloud leaving the mountain is like me leaving my homeland.' Later, Li Bai adapted this sentiment in his line, 'The floating clouds—a wanderer’s heart.' Here, Wei Yingwu compares their decade of separation to the gathering and scattering of clouds, capturing both the passage of time and unspoken reflections on the transience of official life.",
      "background": "On the day of composition, Wei Yingwu was handling documents at his Huai River office. Startled by news of his friend’s arrival, he overturned an inkstone in excitement. Rushing out, he barely noticed ink staining his official robe. By dusk at the ferry, the pair drank from their old vessels, laughing about the time they mistook reeds for perch while fishing drunk. As night dew thickened, Wei Yingwu felt the lump of native soil hidden in his friend’s sleeve—his eyes welled with tears.",
      "additional_info": "Notably, during his tenure in Liangzhou, Wei Yingwu was once fined for drunkenness, later mocking himself in verse: 'Even the drunkard’s scold couldn’t wake me.' For this reunion, the friend brought the recipe from their old tavern, only to learn its owner had long passed.",

The poet gazed into their clear eyes, his throat trembling with the familiar cadence of his native tongue, only to realize he had become a stranger in his own hometown.",
      "allusion": "When He Zhizhang retired and returned to his hometown at the age of eighty-six, he once encountered his grandchildren fishing by Mirror Lake. The children playfully surrounded the old man who spoke the Wu dialect, and when he mentioned his grandfather's name, the eldest child suddenly knelt down and exclaimed, 'You are Lord He, whose name is written on the first page of our family records!' The old poet trembled as he touched the child's head, tears falling onto the jade pendant engraved with the family emblem, producing a faint, melodious sound.",
      "background": "In the early spring of the Tianbao era's third year, He Zhizhang dreamed of Mirror Lake, where he had gathered water chestnuts as a child, while lying on his sickbed. Upon waking, he immediately petitioned Emperor Xuanzong to retire. The emperor personally composed a farewell poem for him. On the journey home, in the carriage, he repeatedly polished the bronze mirror he had carried for fifty years, watching the wrinkles etched with the hardships of Chang'an in its reflection, yet never managing to clear the haze that obscured the image of his hometown in his clouded eyes.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, the ginkgo tree He Zhizhang planted at the village entrance when he left home had grown tall and lush by the time he returned. Villagers often saw him beneath the tree, revising his poems over and over.

Running his fingers over the faded carvings, he seemed to see an immortal riding a crane through the white clouds above. 'Last time I climbed this tower, Brother Wang was still by my side, drinking and composing poetry...' He gazed at the silhouettes of trees on the far bank of Hanyang, gradually blurring in the twilight, when suddenly he was startled by a fisherman's song drifting across the river—a boatman was passing by the Parrot Isle, lush with spring grass. A pang of sorrow welled up in his heart: 'Amid these vast misty waters, where lies my path home?'",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that after Fei Yi became an immortal, he often took the form of a yellow crane to rest at a tavern. One day, a poor scholar arrived at the tavern, and just as the owner was about to shoo him away, a yellow crane flew out from the scholar's sleeve. 'How about using this crane to pay for the wine?' the scholar said with a laugh. For the next ten years, the crane brought golden cups to serve wine to patrons, until one day a clear flute melody echoed from the white clouds. The crane suddenly burst through the window lattice and soared into the sky, leaving only the flute's lingering notes resonating in the beams for three days.",
      "background": "Cui Hao passed through Wuchang just before the An Lushan Rebellion erupted, at a time when he had recently suffered setbacks in his official career. While climbing the tower, he saw children playing with bamboo horses and suddenly recalled childhood memories of watching cranes here with his father. 'Father once said the yellow crane was a spiritual guide, capable of carrying homesickness back home...' He clutched a letter from home in his sleeve, the river wind rustling the paper mockingly, as if taunting him for drifting through half a lifetime without achieving fame or success. The distant calls of ferrymen at the dock only deepened his solitude.",

Li Bai watched the solitary sail gradually vanish, then suddenly flung his wine flask into the river: 'Can these surging waters bear the weight of my parting sorrow?'",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that the two once drank heavily for three days at the Yellow Crane Tower. Upon parting, a drunken Meng Haoran inscribed on the wall: 'All that remains here is the Yellow Crane Tower.' Li Bai immediately added: 'Amidst the misty blossoms of March, you descend to Yangzhou.' When the tavern keeper came to wipe the wall, Meng Haoran hurriedly shielded the ink stains with his sleeve, oblivious to the cinnabar staining his cuff.",

Li Bai gazed at his frail figure, recalling how, a decade earlier by Dongting Lake, this very scholar had scooped moonlight for him with a lotus leaf.",

Wang Wei, immersed in his mountain retreat, admires the morning glory blooming at dawn and withering by dusk, and gathers dew-laden mallows under pine trees for his vegetarian meals. When he chats with villagers like an ordinary old farmer, even the seagulls no longer regard him with suspicion—now he has become one with the landscape.",
      "allusion": "The phrase 'seagulls regarding him with suspicion' alludes to a parable from 'Liezi': A young man by the sea played with gulls daily, and they flocked to him. His father asked him to catch a few, but the next day the gulls circled warily overhead. Wang Wei uses this to imply he has shed the cunning of officialdom—even the most vigilant gulls now see him as part of nature.",

'Brother Yuanxi, look at these Wei Purple and Yao Yellow...' Li Dan's laughter as he plucked a flower to gift him still echoed in his ears, but now the scene was the same yet the people were gone. Running his fingers over the pile of official documents beside the medicine stove, thoughts of the displaced refugees in his jurisdiction overwhelmed him. A violent cough seized him, and he heavily inscribed the words 'ashamed of my salary' onto the memorial.",
      "allusion": "The line 'ashamed of my salary while the people flee' alludes to the story of Lian Fan from the Eastern Han Dynasty. As governor of Shu Commandery, Lian Fan had enforced a nightly fire ban, forcing citizens to bore holes in walls for light. Upon learning of their hardship, he lamented, 'My salary comes from the people's sweat and blood, yet I've brought them such suffering!' He immediately lifted the curfew, and the people composed the 'Song of Lian Shudu' in his praise. When Wei Yingwu served as governor of Chuzhou during a drought and locust plague, he opened granaries but still saw refugees. Gazing at the moon late at night, he sighed, 'If even Lian Fan felt ashamed of his salary, how can I not?'",

The poet caressed the envelope adorned with twin-carp patterns, reminiscing about his days as an aide in Linghu Chu's household.

Staring at his prematurely graying reflection in the bronze mirror, he abruptly set down his ink-laden brush—the once-elegant youth who had 'danced with fish and dragons all night' in the Linghu household now lacked even the strength to reply, as if sapped by the autumn rain.",

The poet grabs a wine gourd, intending to brave the rain and bring warmth, but all he sees are falling leaves blanketing the empty mountain—even footprints are buried under golden layers. Where could the hermit's traces still be found? Between the lines flows his concern for the recluse beyond the mundane world and his melancholy over worldly entanglements.",

The old friend, who loved brewing tea with pine branches, must now be cultivating in even deeper mountains, he thought. The undried ink in the inkstone reflected the flickering candlelight as he lifted his brush, his sleeve accidentally knocking over the almanac on the desk—it flipped open to the page marked 'Cold Dew.'",

      "meaning": "At dawn, Cen Shen and Du Fu walked side by side up the vermilion palace steps, the starlight of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure still lingering at the edge of the sky. 'Brother Du, today we must again part ways to our respective offices,' Cen Shen said with a bitter smile, pointing to the government buildings on the east and west sides. At dusk, as he brushed his sleeves, still fragrant with imperial incense, and headed home, a white petal suddenly drifted onto his shoulder—only to realize it was a strand of white hair from his own temples. Gazing up at the carefree birds soaring among the clouds, he murmured to himself, 'Fewer and fewer memorials of remonstrance are submitted. Is it because the sage court is flawless, or have we grown too old to speak boldly?'",
      "allusion": "During the reign of Emperor Suzong of Tang, Du Fu served as Left Reminder, responsible for offering admonitions. One day during court, when the emperor proposed expanding the imperial retreat, Du Fu immediately stepped forward: 'Your Majesty, the famine in Guanzhong has yet to subside...' Before he could finish, Chancellor Li Kui sneered, 'Reminder Du always knows how to spoil the mood.' The emperor stormed off. Later, Du Fu wrote in 'Lodging in the Left Office in Spring': 'Tomorrow I have a sealed memorial to submit, / How many times I ask how the night progresses,' capturing the anxiety of a remonstrance official. Cen Shen's poem is a veiled metaphor for his old friend's predicament.",
      "background": "In Chang'an during the first year of the Qianyuan era (758), spring rain fell incessantly. As Cen Shen sorted documents in his duty room, a plum blossom petal drifted in through the window. It reminded him of the previous day, when he saw Du Fu stooping to pick up a memorial paper blown away by the wind—his hunched figure a far cry from the upright posture of their shared ascent of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda years ago. On the still-damp poem draft, the phrase 'I feel remonstrances grow scarce' had been repeatedly revised—this frontier poet had finally learned the art of measured speech in officialdom.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, after receiving this poem, Du Fu responded with 'In Reply to Cen the Supplementor’s Gift,' in which the lines 'An old friend sends fine verses, / Solely to this white-haired man' revealed that Cen Shen, too, had prematurely grayed.

As the setting sun dyed Lake Taihu gold and crimson, he suddenly felt that the receding sail was carrying away all the warmth of spring.",

Following the sound, he saw a feathered Taoist playing the flute by the water. The Taoist smiled and asked, 'Do you understand the language of duckweeds? They turn white at partings and blush red when meeting kindred spirits.' With that, he tossed his flute into the water, where it transformed into a vast expanse of white duckweeds. Since then, poets have often used white duckweeds to symbolize the sorrow of separation.",

When Zhang Ji unrolled the scroll, the image of a bashful bride appeared before him, and he couldn't help but smile. The next day, he penned a reply: 'Even fine silks cannot compare to the worth of this age; a single song of the water chestnut rivals ten thousand gold.'—this tentative 'testing of the eyebrow's depth' ultimately secured Zhu's promise of success on the golden list.",

The winding islands faded in and out of view in the twilight, merging with the emerald hues of distant mountains. Suddenly, a horse neighed as it departed on a ferry, while travelers resting under willow trees awaited returning boats. Flocks of gulls startled from the reeds on the sandbar, and across the vast expanse of river fields, only a lone egret soared. This scene reminded him of the典故 of Fan Li, who retired after achieving greatness and sailed the Five Lakes. He couldn't help but sigh: Who could be like Fan Li, casting aside worldly cunning to lose themselves in nature?",
      "allusion": "During the Spring and Autumn period, Fan Li, a minister of Yue, helped Goujian destroy Wu. Knowing the adage 'When the cunning hare dies, the hound is stewed,' he quietly warned his friend Wen Zhong: 'When the flying birds are gone, the good bow is put away. It's time for us to leave.' Wen Zhong didn't listen and was eventually executed. Fan Li, however, took Xi Shi and vanished into Lake Tai on a small boat. Legend says he thrice gave away his wealth and thrice regained it, later revered as the 'Sage of Business.' This典故 became a symbol of scholarly yearning for transcendence.",

An old fisherman resting under a willow told him: 'This ferry sends off three hundred fame-seekers every day.' The words pierced his heart like a thorn, and that night at the post station, he wrote this poem.",

A thought struck him: Shouldn't the messenger from Nanling have arrived by now? Yet the courier station remained silent. The poet shook his head with a bitter smile—could it be that his distant wife had mistaken his dream of a new love as reality?",

Legend has it that King Xuan of Zhou dreamed of a beautiful woman at night and, upon waking, ordered painters to sketch her likeness to find her. His minister, Duke Shao, advised: 'Dreams are illusory; if you insist on searching, you may harm the innocent.' Unrolling a bamboo scroll, he recounted how King Zhou of Shang had brought about his kingdom's downfall by obsessing over dream omens.

He turned and hastily penned this poem, the ink still wet when urgent military dispatches interrupted—news of a bloody battle on the frontlines.",

Later research revealed that the cups were embedded with fluorescent powder, whereas the Tang Dynasty’s luminous cups were actually made of Hetian jade, their glow an illusion from moonlight refraction.

      "meaning": "On a winter night, Du Mu lodged alone at an inn by the Xiang River. The oil lamp flickered in the cold wind as he caressed the yellowed pages of a family letter—this missive, sent the previous year, had only now found its way to him. Suddenly, the mournful cry of a lone wild goose pierced the night sky, startling the poet from his shallow slumber. In a daze, he dreamed of returning home through the morning mist, only to find a stranger's fishing boat tied at his doorstep. So deep was his longing that he had mistaken the misty moon of a foreign land for the scenery of his hometown.",
      "allusion": "The phrase 'lone wild goose' in the poem alludes to a story from 'Liezi·Tang Wen': when Boya played the qin, a solitary goose, moved by the music, fell from the sky. That night, as Du Mu sat alone by the window and heard the goose's piercing cry, he couldn't help but murmur to the lamp: 'In the past, Boya's music could make geese pause—can my sorrow now borrow your wings to fly home?' The shadow of the goose swept past the window lattice, causing the lamp's flame to flicker uncertainly.",
      "background": "In the late autumn of 839 AD, Du Mu stopped by the Xiang River en route to his new post. The dilapidated wooden window of the courier station let in drafts, and he tightened his official robe, gazing at the thin layer of ice forming in his inkstone. Suddenly, laughter and chatter from traveling merchants next door reached his ears. With a bitter smile, he dipped his brush and wrote: 'They say the misty moon over the Xiang River is beautiful, but without a kindred spirit to share it...' His brush paused, and the ink bled into the character for 'solitude,' staining it with melancholy.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, when Su Shi of the Song Dynasty was in Huangzhou, he imitated this poem with the line 'a lone lamp illuminates the sleepless guest,' but changed 'fishing boat' to 'fish-selling boat.' Later critics quipped: 'Du Mu's sorrow is the refined melancholy of a scholar, while Dongpo's sorrow reeks of fish.'",

      "meaning": "On a night when moonlight flowed like water, Du Fu huddled in a rocking solitary boat. The river breeze rustled through slender grasses as he gazed at the mast casting its lonely shadow in the darkness. Suddenly, at the edge of the vast plain, the Milky Way cascaded down, and the moonlight shattered into countless silver scales upon the river's surface. Stroking his graying beard with a bitter smile, he murmured, 'The world praises my poetic fame, but who sees this drifting, aging, ailing body?' A sandpiper skimmed across the water, and the poet's eyes suddenly welled up—realizing he was but a feather with no place to land in this vast universe.",
      "allusion": "The sandpiper allusion originates from 'Liezi': A young boy by the sea played with sandpipers daily, and the birds perched on his shoulders. His father urged him to catch a few, but the next day, the sandpipers only circled in the air. When Du Fu adapted this allusion, an old boatman suddenly remarked, 'Sir, see how free that white gull is!' The poet replied absently, 'Rather, it has nowhere to belong.' The flickering fishing lights at the stern danced between their words.",
      "background": "In 765, when Yan Wu passed away, Du Fu lost his support in Shu. On the night he left Chengdu, clutching a medicine jar as he boarded the boat, he heard someone on the shore reciting his poems. 'What use is such empty fame?' he coughed, unfolding a yellowed official document where the words 'retired due to age and illness' glared under the moonlight. Suddenly, the great river surged with silver waves, scattering fifty years of life's joys and sorrows into the shimmering ripples.",
      "additional_info": "The Song Dynasty painting academy once set 'The Milky Way Hangs Over the Vast Plain' as a competition theme.

The poet gazed at the rising sun of the new emperor's ascension, yet his mind wandered to the scene a century earlier at the Jingyang Palace well, where Emperor Chen and Lady Zhang Lihua were hauled out by Sui soldiers in disgrace—proof that the divine wisdom of emperors is ultimately measured by the bones of beauties.",
      "allusion": "In 589 AD, Sui troops stormed Jiankang. As palace maids shrieked 'The enemy has breached the palace!', Emperor Chen Shubao was drinking with his beloved consort Zhang Lihua in the Jieqi Pavilion. 'Your Majesty, flee!' a eunuch screamed. In panic, the emperor dragged Zhang Lihua and Consort Kong into a dry well at Jingyang Hall. 'Hush—' He covered his consort's mouth until ropes descended.

On the eve of departure, he drank deeply with Zhang Ji at a tavern in Chang'an: 'This time, we will surely crush the Yuezhi!' Captain Wang pressed his family heirloom jade pendant into his friend's hand. Two years later, grim news arrived from the front.

Gazing at the drifting clouds outside the window, he thinks of Li Bai, exiled to Yelang, whom he has not seen for years. For three nights in a row, Li Bai appears in his dreams, always hurriedly bidding farewell: \"The rivers and lakes are treacherous with storms—I fear these old bones will end up in the bellies of fish!\" In the dream, his old friend scratches his white hair and sighs, a stark contrast to the carriages and horses of Chang'an's high-ranking officials. Startled awake, Du Fu writes through tears: \"Even if you win eternal fame, who will know the loneliness that follows after?\"",
      "allusion": "In the third year of the Tianbao era, Li Bai and Du Fu first met in Luoyang. Inside a tavern, the 44-year-old Li Bai clapped the 33-year-old Du Fu on the shoulder and laughed heartily: 'Young friend Du, behold my \"Invitation to Wine\"!' The two wandered together through Liang and Song, drunkenly reclining beneath pine forests. After the An Lushan Rebellion, Li Bai was exiled to Yelang due to his involvement with Prince Yong. Legend has it that as his boat reached Baidicheng, the mournful cries of apes echoed from the cliffs, when suddenly the boatman shouted: 'A pardon has arrived!' The newly enthroned emperor had declared a general amnesty. This dramatic twist later inspired the famous line, 'At dawn I left Baidicheng's rainbow clouds behind.'",
      "background": "In the late autumn of 759, Du Fu coughed up blood in his humble thatched cottage in Qinzhou (modern-day Tianshui). Amidst the chaos of war, he had heard of Li Bai's pardon but never received any letters from him. On a frost-heavy dawn, he dreamed of Li Bai struggling in treacherous rapids aboard a small boat. When he awoke, he found his pillow soaked with tears. Outside, the hoarse clappers of the night watchman echoed. Trembling, he ground ink and poured his longing for his dear friend and his bewilderment at fate into the lines of his poetry.",

      "meaning": "On a moonlit night in late autumn, in a mansion within Chang'an city, the host was holding an intimate gathering of wine and zither music. Amidst the flickering candlelight, a zither player from Guangling plucked the strings, letting the crisp notes of 'Green Water' and the mournful tones of 'Chu Concubine' flow in succession. When the music began, even the crows under the eaves ceased flapping their wings, and all the guests held their breath in rapt attention until the stars in the sky gradually faded. A poet, about to depart for official duties by the Huai River, listened to the melodies and suddenly realized: this strand of zither music marked the beginning of his farewell to his homeland of cloud-capped mountains.",
      "allusion": "The poem subtly alludes to the legend of 'Guangling San.' During the Wei-Jin period, Ji Kang, before his execution, requested a zither and played this piece, sighing, 'Guangling San is lost forever!' A millennium later, the Guangling guest in Li Qi's poem revived the long-lost masterpiece. Legend has it that the zither player, drunk that night, confessed, 'This is not the true Guangling San, but my late teacher's imitation of Ji Zhongsan's lingering melody.' As he spoke, his fingers lightly brushed the scorch marks at the end of the zither—a deliberate imitation of the marks left when Ji Kang burned his zither in flames.",
      "background": "On a cold night in the third year of the Tianbao era, Li Qi held a warm wine cup at a farewell banquet hosted by friends. The moment a candle wick crackled, he noticed frost clinging to the zither player's sleeves from his journey. When the sorrowful notes of 'Chu Concubine' stirred homesickness, he suddenly stood up, knocking over a bronze brazier. Amidst the flying sparks, he inscribed the poem on the wall—with the same resolve Ji Kang had shown when playing the zither at his execution ground.",
      "additional_info": "Tang Dynasty banquets often followed the tradition of 'concluding with elegance,' but this poem records the rare spectacle of 'mid-music epiphany.' Later scholars discovered that Li Qi's post in Xin'an County coincided with places Ji Kang once visited. The phrase 'serving by the clear Huai' in the poem might subtly imply a deeper quest to trace the footsteps of the ancients.",

Pushing open the window, he saw a bluebird circling persistently, its claws tied with a red string holding a gilded letter—an invitation from his favorite otherworldly friend, Taoist Mei. The poet's melancholy instantly dissolved, and he dashed through the carpet of fallen blossoms toward the Taoist temple.",
      "additional_info": "Tang Dynasty Taoists often used 'flowing rosé' as a metaphor for immortal wine.

As warships blotted out the river, soldiers saw their white-haired general standing atop the terrace, beating war drums. In his later years, he was captured by Northern Zhou.

The water carried pink-white petals past his cloth shoes, their fragrance drifting away with the current.

Noon sunlight filtered through the branches, casting golden speckles on his faded blue robe.",

Just as disappointment set in, he glimpsed fresh ink on a riverside stone table—unfinished chapters of Lu Yu's new *Classic of Tea*. Brushing petals off the paper, he smiled in understanding.",

As scraps snowflaked into the stream, he froze—those petals carrying ink strokes seemed more alive than bureaucratic writings.

By the Black River, she planted a willow branch from her homeland. The next spring, it took root and sprouted in the frontier, and her tomb was later called the 'Green Tomb.'

Pointing to the distant Mount Wozhou, he added, 'Don’t buy that hermitage—even the woodcutters know where the sages dwell!' Between the lines, his words carried both teasing and a yearning for transcendence.",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that during the Eastern Jin Dynasty, the eminent monk Zhi Dun once sought to purchase Mount Wozhou for seclusion. A local farmer laughed and said, 'Master, you wish to buy the mountain? But the apes and cranes there won’t recognize a new owner!' Zhi Dun had an epiphany and composed a verse: 'I sought to buy Wozhou for retreat, yet who knew it was already a sacred ground.' This story later became a classic literary allusion for mocking false recluses.",
      "background": "One drizzly morning, Liu Changqing was brewing tea when he heard the clatter of wooden sandals approaching.

Finally, he patted his friends' shoulders: 'A sage era will surely recall you. Treat this parting as but a brief journey.'",
      "allusion": "The allusion to the wailing gibbons of Wu Gorge originates from the 'Commentary on the Water Classic': Fishermen moored at night would weep upon hearing three cries of the gibbons. The poet Li Daoyuan recorded that when merchants passed through Wu Gorge, they suddenly heard the heart-wrenching cries of gibbons echoing from the cliffs, moving all in their party to cover their faces and weep. Thus, 'three cries of the gibbons stain clothes with tears' became a symbol of parting sorrow.",

When these maple leaves turn red again, we shall surely reunite.'",

The poet gazed in the direction of his departing friend, his heart filled with sorrow and longing.",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that Master Lingche was a renowned poet-monk of the Tang Dynasty and shared a deep friendship with Liu Changqing. One evening, after discussing philosophy over tea at the Bamboo Grove Temple, Lingche insisted on returning to his mountain monastery under the cover of night. Liu Changqing urged him, 'The mountain path is treacherous—why not wait until dawn?' Lingche smiled and replied, 'The moon shall light my way, the breeze my companion.' With that, he donned his bamboo hat and departed gracefully, leaving Liu Changqing standing at the temple gate for a long while.",

On this day, as he bid farewell to Lingche, the evening bells tolled and bamboo shadows swayed.

He took out a bamboo slip he carried and, under the last rays of the setting sun, inscribed this Zen-infused farewell poem.",

A sudden river gust swept by, and he counted the scattered boats on the water: 'Who knows when we'll meet again after this parting?' With that, he pulled a wineskin from his robe, tilted his head back for a deep draught, the liquor mingling with tears that soaked his collar.",
      "allusion": "The line 'resolutely leaving the old pass' subtly alludes to the legend of Meng Haoran. It is said that in his youth, Meng Haoran once crossed the river dressed in white and shared a drink with an old fisherman beneath Xiangyang's walls. The fisherman asked, 'Young man, why do you travel alone?' Meng Haoran slapped his sword and sang: 'Thirty restless years, yet neither books nor swords have brought achievement!' With that, he tossed his gourd into the river and strode away over the waves. This scene later became a classic motif of farewell in Tang poetry.",

'Brother Wen, look—the morning glow over Yingmen!' his friend suddenly exclaimed, pointing into the distance. But when Wen turned, his friend had already leaped onto the boat's prow, leaving only a gallant silhouette against the morning light. That moment was forever etched into his poetry.",

Most moving was the lone lantern at the prow, like the glass lamp Jōjō had gifted at parting—still bright across ten thousand miles of rolling waves.",

The vessel sailed through the air without gathering a speck of dust, symbolizing the Dharma's power to ferry all beings beyond suffering. Qian Qi deliberately chose this imagery to liken the serene voyage home to the practice of *prajnaparamita*—just as the Indian monk Bodhidharma once crossed the river on a reed, a single blade sufficing to navigate the sea of life and death.",

After losing imperial favor, Ban Jieyu composed 'Fu on Pounding Silk' in Changxin Palace upon hearing the pounding of laundry mallets: 'Each pounding shock shatters the Rainbow and Feather Robe Dance.' Through this allusion, Li Qi seems to foresee Wei Wan sitting alone in Chang'an's deep night, listening to those same aging-accelerating mallet beats.",

Li Bai laughed heartily and slapped his saddle, retorting, 'Let’s wager with wine instead! If I can compose a poem in three steps, you must take this jar of Lanling fine wine on your journey.'

Gazing up at the broken moon over the northern sky, he sees again the lonely figure of Su Wu, draped in the winds of the frontier, driving his flock home. The palaces of Han were no longer as they once were, and the valiant youth who had set out with a sword returned as a white-haired old man.

Exiled to the North Sea, he survived by eating snow and felt, herding sheep, never letting go of the staff even as its tassels frayed away. Nineteen years later, Han envoys deceived the Chanyu by claiming, 'The Son of Heaven shot down a wild goose with a silk message tied to its leg.' The Chanyu paled in shock. When the aged Su Wu finally returned, the people of Chang’an lined the streets to welcome him, only to find he still carried the bare, tassel-less staff in his arms.",

In that moment, the lonely poet and the bright moon became kindred spirits.",

Meng Haoran smiled bitterly: 'Drifting half a life, like this lone boat on the river.' The fisherman pointed at the moon's reflection in the water: 'Look, the moon keeps you company!'

Gazing at the unfamiliar landscapes of Jiande, his heart flew back to Yangzhou, where scenes of drinking and conversing with old friends flashed vividly before his eyes. At this moment, he dipped his brush in moonlight to compose his verses, letting his tears flow with the river toward distant beloved friends.",

Back then, Li Bai had clapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Brother Haoran, your poetry should flow like the Yangtze River to the sea.' Now, touching his sleeves dampened by the river water, he chuckled bitterly: 'Now I’ve truly become a lone boat adrift.'",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, twenty years later, Li Bai passed through this area and wrote 'Night Moored at Niuzhu, Remembering the Past,' in which the line 'boarding the boat to gaze at the autumn moon' serves as a distant echo to Meng Haoran’s poem.

The clear stream shimmered silver under the moonlight, and the light filtering through the pine branches seemed like lanterns lit especially for an old friend. By the thatched pavilion, flower shadows swayed gently in the wind, and moss crept over the stone steps of the herb garden—everything here whispered that though the master had departed, the mountain retreat still held the gentlest wait for him. As the poet traced the mottled moss stains, he suddenly heard the clear cry of a phoenix from the western mountains, as if summoning him to join this covenant of seclusion.",
      "allusion": "During the Kaiyuan era, Wang Changling built a humble dwelling in the Stone Gate Valley of Lantian. On the day Chang Jian visited, the host happened to be away gathering herbs. A woodcutter pointed to the thatched hut deep in the mist and said, 'Master Wang often claims the mountain moon as his old friend, leaving a pot of pine-dew wine for their nightly toast.' Pushing open the unlatched gate, Chang Jian found wine vessels still on the stone table, with moonlight slanting across the still-wet ink in the inkstone—a half-finished poem dedicated to the mountain moon.",
      "background": "Standing in his friend’s empty pavilion, Chang Jian’s fingers brushed the dust-covered strings of a zither. Three years earlier, while admiring plum blossoms and discussing poetry here, Wang Changling had once laughed and gestured to the western mountains, saying, 'If one day you see phoenixes welcoming us, that will be our time to retire.' Now, plum blossoms bloomed again before the pavilion, but only scattered crane footprints remained on the ground. The poet suddenly understood that those seemingly casual promises had been foreshadowing all along. He untied his official seal and hung it on a pine branch, then bowed deeply toward the direction of the phoenix’s call.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, when later generations compiled Wang Changling’s poetry, they discovered a poem titled 'Reply in the Mountains' that perfectly echoed Chang Jian’s work: 'You ask when I’ll return—no date is set, / But the mountain moon will tell you on my behalf.'

By the time he arrived, he found only half a cup of warm tea on the qin table under the moonlight, the strings still faintly vibrating—Meng Haoran had left mere moments earlier. Thereafter, the two often laughed about this amusing incident of the 'lingzhi-delayed rendezvous.'",

He seemed to see the emperor pointing toward Yangzhou, declaring, \"We shall make this city our new capital!\" Had the imperial seal not fallen into Li Yuan's hands, the emperor's embroidered sails might have journeyed to the ends of the earth. Now, no fireflies flickered in the rotting grass (where the emperor once ordered them caught for his nocturnal revels), only the mournful caws of crows in the weeping willows. The poet couldn't help but wonder: If Emperor Yang were to meet the Later Ruler of Chen in the underworld, would he still dare ask about the song \"Jade Tree and Rear Court Flowers\"?",
      "allusion": "The story of Emperor Yang of Sui and the Last Ruler of Chen: In the past, the Last Ruler of Chen lost his kingdom while indulging in the song and dance of *Jade Trees and Backyard Flowers*. Legend has it that when Emperor Yang of Sui traveled to Jiangdu, he once dreamed of encountering the Last Ruler of Chen. Emperor Yang smugly asked, \"How does my *Spring River on a Flower Moon Night* compare to your *Backyard Flowers*?\" The Last Ruler of Chen sneered, \"The pot calling the kettle black.\" Sure enough, not long after, the Sui dynasty also fell. This detail comes from *Records of Sui's Lost Legacy*, which Li Shangyin skillfully adapted, allowing the two fallen rulers to converse across time in his poetry.",
      "background": "On an autumn evening, Li Shangyin passed by the ruins of the Sui Palace. The cawing of crows pierced the silence as he stumbled upon a broken brick still bearing traces of gilding. Suddenly, a gust of wind rustled the weeping willows, their whispers seeming to recount the extravagance of bygone days. The poet, reflecting on his own tumultuous career, saw little difference between himself and those decadent emperors. Overcome with indignation, he picked up a piece of charcoal and scrawled this satirical poem on the crumbling wall. As he finished the last line, the faint strumming of a pipa echoed through the twilight, startling him so much that the charcoal slipped from his fingers.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Li Shangyin may have intentionally altered a detail: historical records state that Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty caught fireflies, yet the line \"rotten grass yields no fireflies\" in the poem actually alludes to the *Book of Rites* phrase \"rotten grass turns into fireflies.\" This deliberate \"mistake\" deepens the satire—even the fireflies are ashamed to glow for a tyrant.",

One harsh winter, seeing the plum blossoms braving the cold in solitary bloom, he spontaneously recited: \"Unyielding to the snowstorms faced by couriers, I shall let the proud heavens know our Han plums.\" Pointing into the distance, he added, 'When you climb the heights tomorrow, my lord, you'll surely see the descendants of those very plum trees.'",
      "background": "In the late autumn of 705 AD (Shenlong era's first year), Song Zhiwen, demoted to military advisor of Shuangzhou, arrived at Dayu Ridge. In the dusk, gazing at the post station's mottled walls, he recalled the glory of admiring peonies in Luoyang just half a year prior. A sudden coughing fit interrupted his reminiscence—the Lingnan miasma had already invaded his lungs. Trembling, he ground ink and wrote beneath the oil lamp: 'Tomorrow when I gaze toward home, I should see Longtou's plum blossoms.' The ink remained stubbornly wet in the humid air.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Dayu Ridge's plum blossoms later became a standard literary motif. When Ming dynasty playwright Tang Xianzu was exiled to Xuwen, he deliberately detoured to Plum Pass just to verify whether 'one should see Longtou's plums' held true.

Li Bai, entranced, seemed to hear the roar of wind through countless pines, the pure notes washing away his wanderer's sorrow like flowing water, the lingering tones blending with distant frost bells.

Once, when Pei Di composed a poem about plum blossoms in the snow, Wang Wei immediately accompanied him by playing the zither indoors.

Stroking the weathered stones, he sighed: 'I long to cross the lake but lack a boat; idle in this golden age, I am ashamed.' Suddenly spotting fishermen hauling brimming nets, he clenched his sleeves and murmured: 'I have only envy for their catch—when will my talents find their use?'",

The sight before him set his blood ablaze—flags fluttered fiercely in the Han army camp, and soldiers drilled to the thunder of war drums. The icy glare of snow reflected the morning light, intertwining with the battle banners. He seemed to see beacon smoke rising straight toward the moon over the barbarian lands, while the city of Ji stood majestic amidst cloud-capped mountains.

Suddenly, a mountain breeze swept by, and layers of clouds swirled before Du Fu's chest.

      "meaning": "At the banquet where candlelight flickered, Li Shangyin gazed at the woman wearing a jade hairpin across the table. When the maid passed the golden hook for a drinking game, their fingertips lightly brushed against each other on the lacquered tray, like two phoenix tree leaves swirling in the autumn breeze. 'This warm wine cannot compare to the spring in your eyes,' he murmured, lowering his head to hide his burning ears, only to hear the faint sound of her sleeve brushing against the harp strings—she, too, was counting the night's water clock, waiting for the morning drums that would hasten their parting.",
      "allusion": "During a hunt in the Yunmeng Marshes, King Chu's attendants suddenly pointed to the sky and exclaimed, 'Look! A phoenix is circling Your Majesty's chariot!' But the hermit Guiguzi shook his head and said, 'A phoenix perches only on the phoenix tree. This must be the spirit of the rhinoceros horn Your Majesty buried in Lantai last night.' It turned out King Chu, seeking talented scholars, had carved a phoenix-shaped rhinoceros horn and buried it in the palace gardens. That night, as the Star of Literature passed overhead, the horn transformed into golden light that soared into the heavens.",
      "background": "Clutching the faded sleeves of his blue robe, Li Shangyin paced restlessly in his office at the Secretariat. The scent of osmanthus drifted through the window, and he suddenly set down his vermilion brush—was the woman who had secretly kept his poem at last night's banquet also smelling these blossoms? The ink in his inkstone rippled unexpectedly; he had absentmindedly mistaken morning dew for water to grind his ink. In the distance, the drum signaling the morning roll call startled a turtledove preening under the eaves.",
      "additional_info": "A Song Dynasty scholar, emulating the phrase 'hearts linked by a spiritual rhinoceros horn,' bought a rhinoceros horn cup to drink from while composing love poems. Drunk, he accidentally shattered the cup, only to discover red thread-like veins in the fragments. Overjoyed, he inscribed on the wall: 'The rhinoceros horn's magic does not deceive!' But the innkeeper demanded compensation—it was actually a fake mixed with cinnabar.",

      "meaning": "In the deep night, candlelight flickered as a woman sewed a round canopy of emerald-patterned silk with her delicate fingers, layering several folds of phoenix-tailed gauze. She recalled their chance encounter in the daytime market: when his carriage thundered past, she hastily covered her moon-like face with a round fan, not even exchanging a single word. Now, the lampwick had grown cold, and the pomegranates blushed red again, yet there was still no news of him—only the faint sound of silver scissors threading through fabric, accompanied by sighs.",
      "allusion": "The poem subtly alludes to the典故 of Ban Jieyu's 'Round Fan Poem' from the Han Dynasty. During Emperor Cheng of Han's reign, the talented Ban Jieyu composed the poem 'Newly cut Qi silk, pure as frost and snow' to liken herself to a fan. That day, when she saw the emperor's carriage pass by, she dared not approach due to the favor shown to the Zhao Feiyan sisters, covering her face with the fan instead. Li Shangyin ingeniously adapts this tale of 'the autumn fan discarded,' turning the moon-bright round fan in the woman's hand into a symbol of love's disappointment.",
      "background": "One spring night, Li Shangyin heard the sound of a loom from the neighboring room in a Luoyang inn. Peering through the window, he saw a woman sewing by lamplight, her silhouette cast on the wall like a painting. Suddenly, she paused, needle in hand, and shed tears—outside the window, a pomegranate tree bore a faded red ribbon tied by her lover the year before. The poet, reminded of his own unfulfilled romance with Lady Liu Zhi, took up his brush as candle wax mingled with ink stains, weaving the longing of two separate moments into the poem.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Li Shangyin often used 'pomegranate' to暗示 romantic affairs. Tang Dynasty weddings featured the custom of 'a hundred pomegranate seeds' symbolizing fertility. In the poem, 'the pomegranate's red' contrasts poignantly with 'the lamp's dying glow'—love extinguished, yet the pomegranate's vivid hue seems to mock the woman's faithful waiting.",

      "meaning": "On a drizzling spring evening, the poet sits alone by the window. The east wind carries fine rain to tap lightly on the lattice, while distant thunder rumbles faintly by the lotus pond. The golden toad on the incense burner clenches its chain in its jaws, and amidst the curling smoke, he sees the jade tiger-adorned well pulley turning on the platform. These exquisite artifacts suddenly remind him of two legendary love stories—Jia Chong's daughter peeking through the curtain at the handsome young Han Shou, and the goddess Mi leaving her golden-threaded pillow for Cao Zhi. 'Don't let your spring heart bloom like flowers vying for attention,' he mutters with a bitter smile, crushing the incense ash in his hand. 'Every inch of longing will burn into ashes.'",
      "allusion": "【Jia's Peek Through the Curtain】During the Western Jin Dynasty, the handsome Han Shou served in Jia Chong's household. Jia's youngest daughter secretly watched him through an ornate window, pining away with love. A maid quietly informed Han Shou, and that very night, he climbed over the wall to meet the young lady. Jia Chong only discovered the affair when he caught the exotic fragrance (a tribute gift from the emperor to the Jia family) on Han Shou's body.\n\n【Mi Leaves Her Pillow】Legend says Cao Zhi adored Zhen Mi, but Cao Cao betrothed her to Cao Pi instead. After Zhen Mi's death, Cao Pi gave her golden-threaded pillow to Cao Zhi. On his journey home, Cao Zhi stayed overnight by the Luo River, where Zhen Mi's spirit visited him in a dream. Upon waking, he wrote 'The Goddess of the Luo River.'",
      "background": "One afternoon, with spring thunder murmuring in the distance, Li Shangyin was on duty at the Imperial Secretariat. Light rain dampened the hibiscus in the courtyard, and as he gazed at the dwindling agarwood in the incense burner, he suddenly recalled a fruitless love from his youth. Back then, like Han Shou, he had caught the eye of a nobleman's daughter, only to be forced apart by their difference in status. The bamboo slips of 'The Goddess of the Luo River' on his desk gleamed faintly, and as he dipped his brush, he seemed to see his beloved's golden hairpin glinting in the rain, ink and raindrops blurring together.",
      "additional_info": "The 'golden toad gnawing its chain' in the poem may reflect a real Tang Dynasty incense burner design. A gilded toad-shaped incense holder unearthed in 1970 from Hejia Village in Xi'an astonishingly matches the description—the toad's mouth gripping the lifting chain. Li Shangyin often used objects as metaphors for love; his other poem 'Untitled' similarly employs 'golden kingfisher feathers' and 'embroidered hibiscus' in this manner.",

        "What were the specific details of Han Shou stealing the fragrance?",

      "meaning": "At the fifth watch, the slanting moonlight illuminated the small tower, startling the poet from his dream. He had dreamed of a distant parting with his beloved, crying out in vain to call them back. In haste, he took up his brush to write a letter, the ink not yet fully ground before he hurriedly began. The dim candlelight cast shadows on the screen embroidered with golden kingfishers, while the faint scent of musk drifted through the hibiscus-patterned bed curtains. He thought of Emperor Wu of Han, who once lamented the distant Penglai Mountain, yet his own beloved was ten thousand times farther away than Penglai.",
      "allusion": "'Liu Lang' refers to Emperor Wu of Han, Liu Che. Legend has it that he sent envoys to seek the elixir of immortality on Penglai Mountain but could never reach it. One day, the alchemist Li Shaojun said to the emperor, 'Penglai lies far in the Eastern Sea, beyond mortal reach. Though Your Majesty is the Son of Heaven, it remains as distant as ten thousand mountains.' The emperor was left disheartened, growing even more obsessed with his quest for immortality. This allusion vividly captures the anguish of the unattainable.",
      "background": "In the depths of night, Li Shangyin sat alone in his study, draped in his robe. The sound of the night watch drum drifted through the window as he gazed at the flickering candlelight, thinking of his forcibly separated beloved. The ink pooled in the inkstone, and he lifted his brush only to set it down again, tears staining the letter paper. The golden threads on the screen shimmered in the candlelight, like the last traces of light left by his departing lover. With a heavy sigh, he pressed his brush onto the manuscript, writing the words 'ten thousandfold' with deliberate weight.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Li Shangyin often used opulent imagery like 'golden kingfishers' and 'embroidered hibiscus' to contrast his solitude. His contemporary, the poet Wen Tingyun, once teased, 'Li Shangyin's poetry is like a tower of seven treasures—when dismantled, it loses its form,' unaware that this was precisely Li Shangyin's artistry: constructing a hazy poetic realm through fragmented imagery.",

Beside the lonely post station, the evening wind stirred rolling waves, and the sun sank heavily in the west. In the distance, the mountain walls gradually faded into darkness, and homebound travelers hurried past; nearby, on the reed-covered shore, wild geese alighted, their snow-white feathers strikingly vivid against the dusk. The poet sat alone at the bow, listening to the distant toll of bells, his thoughts wandering to his faraway homeland of Chang'an, restless and sleepless.",
      "allusion": "The phrase 'recalling Qin's passes' in the poem alludes to the典故 of the Han Dynasty general Li Ling. Leading his troops deep into Xiongnu territory, Li Ling was defeated and captured. Emperor Wu of Han, misled by slander, executed his entire family. Hearing the foreign bells in exile, Li Ling lamented, 'Every time I hear the sound of the Hu pipes, my heart and liver feel torn apart!' The poet borrows this to express his own loneliness and homesickness while drifting afar.",
      "background": "In the autumn of 783 AD, Wei Yingwu was en route to assume his post as Prefect of Chuzhou. At dusk that day, his official boat was forced to dock at Xuyi due to stormy winds. Standing on the swaying deck, he gazed at the darkening sky and recalled his demotion for speaking out candidly. Suddenly, a flock of honking geese passed overhead. Turning to his attendant, he sighed, 'Look at these southbound geese—they still know their way home, while I...' With that, he took out paper and brush and composed this poem by flickering candlelight.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Wei Yingwu later revisited the imagery of 'a boat lying sideways' in his poem 'West Gully at Chuzhou,' revealing his fondness for scenes of aquatic solitude.

He seemed more like a joyous mountain farmer!",
      "allusion": "When Liu Zongyuan was exiled to Yongzhou, the local governor deliberately made life difficult for him, assigning him a leaky, dilapidated hut. One day during a heavy storm, the governor feigned concern and asked, 'Magistrate Liu, are you comfortable here?' Liu pointed to the earthen jar catching drips in the corner and laughed, 'Listen, the pitter-patter sounds just like a pipa.'

'This is truly living...' he murmured, dipping his brush to write 'Fortunate in this southern exile,' a faint smile still on his lips.",

The scene of veteran generals kneeling and weeping as the surrender flag rose over Jinling's walls seemed vivid before his eyes. 'The rise and fall of the Six Dynasties are just like this river!' he sighed, touching the cold rock. In the distance, abandoned fortresses rustled amidst the reeds.",

The Eastern Wu defenders stretched iron chains across the river, boasting, 'This is an impregnable natural barrier!' Yet, the Jin army melted the chains overnight, and their warships reached the foot of Stone City. When Wu's ruler Sun Hao surrendered with the imperial jade seal, an old soldier by the river broke his spear in tears, saying, 'Had our founding lord been alive, how could these upstarts have prevailed!'",
      "background": "In the autumn of 824 AD, Liu Yuxi, after twenty-three years in exile, was summoned back to the capital. As his boat passed Xisai Mountain, he stood alone on the deck, his cloak billowing in the wind. The river breeze tousled his graying hair, and suddenly, the fervor of his participation in the Yongzhen Reforms overlapped with the desolate autumn scenery before him. 'Order and chaos, prosperity and decline—they are but ripples in the long river of history,' he mused before turning to his cabin, where he penned this timeless dialogue spanning three centuries.",
      "additional_info": "The 'thousand-xun iron chains' in the poem are an exaggeration; the actual length of the chains was about 500 meters. Interestingly, during dredging of the Yangtze near Nanjing in 1993, fragments of ancient iron chains with burn marks were indeed recovered!",

A child with a topknot dashed out from the wooden gate, and the aroma of freshly brewed rice wine filled the air.

Once, during a snowy night march, his soldiers shivered from the cold.

As the soldiers passed the bowl, he slapped his icy armor and laughed, 'This warms better than the finest liquor in Chang'an!' With that, he shoved the wine bowl into Li Bai's hand—its bottom still clinging to a leaf of cornelian cherry.",

      "meaning": "The sun suddenly slipped behind the mountains, while the moon quietly rose over the pond. Meng Haoran let down his hair, pushed open the south pavilion's window, and reclined on the spacious cooling couch to enjoy the evening breeze. The wind carried the faint fragrance of lotus blossoms, and dewdrops dripped from bamboo leaves, producing crisp sounds. He wished to play his qin, but lamented having no kindred spirit to appreciate it. This deepened his longing for his dear friend Xin Da, with whom he would reunite in dreams until midnight.",
      "allusion": "The line 'lamented having no kindred spirit to appreciate it' alludes to the legend of 'High Mountains and Flowing Waters.' During the Spring and Autumn period, the qin master Boya played in the wilderness, and the woodcutter Zhong Ziqi could discern the imagery of 'majestic as towering mountains' and 'vast as flowing rivers.' Boya exclaimed, 'Your heart resonates with mine!' After Zhong Ziqi's death, Boya smashed his qin and severed its strings, never playing again.",
      "background": "One summer night, Meng Haoran sought respite from the heat in the south pavilion of Xiangyang. The day's warmth lingered, so he loosened his hair and opened his robe. Moonlight bathed the pond as lotus blossoms swayed in the breeze. Suddenly inspired to play the qin, he was reminded that his close friend Xin Da was far away. The absence of this confidant, with whom he often shared tea and poetry, deepened the poet's solitude.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, the imagery of 'loosened hair' frequently appears in Meng Haoran's poetry. This recluse poet indeed defied conventions—the *New Book of Tang* records that he 'valued integrity and delighted in aiding those in distress.' His contemporary Wang Wei once painted his portrait in a Yingzhou pavilion, attesting to his reputation as a refined scholar.",

Suddenly, a frost-feathered crow swept past the eaves of the Zhaoyang Palace, its wingtips tinged with sunlight streaming from within. Stroking her haggard face, she smiled bitterly: 'Even my jade-like beauty cannot compare to a crow's chance to bask in the emperor's favor.'",
      "allusion": "During Emperor Cheng of Han's reign, after falling out of favor, Lady Ban Jieyu voluntarily requested to serve the empress dowager. On that day, the newly favored Zhao Feiyan was dancing in the Zhaoyang Palace, and the emperor clapped his hands, laughing: 'Your dancing is more intoxicating than a round fan.' Hearing the music from the Changxin Palace, Lady Ban tucked away the fan once gifted by the emperor and told her maid: 'A discarded autumn fan—this is my fate.'",
      "background": "While serving as a collator in Chang'an, Wang Changling once passed by an abandoned palace. Autumn winds swirled dead leaves past the mottled palace walls when he suddenly noticed a crow pecking at a persimmon on the tiled eaves, its crimson juice resembling a woman's lip rouge. This scene reminded him of Lady Ban's story he had read in the imperial archives the previous day, prompting him to immediately jot down this poem on the bamboo paper he carried.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, when Tang palace maids secretly sang this poem, they often replaced 'frost-feathered crow' with 'painted-browed bird,' as crow feathers were then fashionable for eyebrow makeup.

The ink bled from melting snowflakes, like mingled blood and tears.",
      "additional_info": "The poem's 'princess's pipa' conceals a musical cipher—the Tang-era pipa piece *Jade Wheel Robe* employs the 'twisted-string' technique to mimic heartrending sounds, still used by modern performers to interpret this poem.

A gentleman in white robes is looking for you!' Lu Yu smiled and said, 'It must be Master Jiaoran. Let him try the purple bamboo shoot tea I left drying by the window.' With that, he pulled a tea cake from his sleeve and handed it to the farmer, then turned and disappeared deeper into the mountains—having anticipated his friend's visit, he had deliberately left behind this year’s spring tea as a gift.",

Back then, he had waited until dusk, only to receive a basket of wild tea still glistening with dew, accompanied by a note that read: 'Fresh tea for fresh poetry.' As the cart wheels rolled over the golden leaves, the poet-monk touched the tea poem tucked in his sleeve and suddenly realized that perhaps this unspoken anticipation was more delightful than the meeting itself.",

White clouds lounged lazily on the sandbar, while the wooden gate was gently veiled by spring grass. Pine needles glistened like emerald after the shower, and he traced the mountain's contour to the stream's source. Suddenly, a cluster of wildflowers swayed in the breeze, facing the stone bench before the Taoist's meditation hut in silent communion—no words were needed, as nature and Zen permeated the soul.",

Jia Dao gazed at the mist-shrouded green mountains, only to see the child tiptoeing and pointing deep into the sea of clouds: 'He’s somewhere in these mountains, but the mist is too thick—no one knows exactly where.' The mountain breeze rustled through the pine needles, its whispers carrying the poet’s faint disappointment.",

Jia Dao was surprised his teacher had foreseen his visit, but the child shook his head: 'The master says this every day, and someone always comes.'

      "meaning": "On an autumn afternoon, a noblewoman leans against the jade railings, gazing absently at the embroidered curtains hanging low. Inside, the crimson screen is painted with broken-branch flowers, and an eight-foot-long dragon-whisker grass mat is spread with a square brocade cushion. She gently strokes the slightly cool brocade, sensing the season shifting from warmth to a faint chill—much like her feelings as she waits for her beloved's return, neither fervent nor icy, lingering in that ambiguous moment just before the cold fully sets in.",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that in his youth, Han Wo once stayed at the home of a Li family official in Chang'an. The young lady of the Li household often peeked at the handsome poet from behind a screen. One autumn day, Han Wo noticed a newly embroidered broken-branch pattern on the screen. As he puzzled over it, he heard the faint jingle of jade pendants behind the screen. Pretending not to notice, he later immortalized the moment in his poetry, turning 'crimson screen painted with broken branches' into a classic image of concealed affection.",
      "background": "On an autumn night in the late Tang dynasty, Han Wo paced his study. The sound of falling parasol leaves outside reminded him of a scene he had witnessed the day before while visiting a friend: an empty boudoir with a neatly spread brocade cushion, unused. Suddenly, he realized this was the most poignant poetic moment—neither the height of summer nor the depths of winter, but that fleeting instant when the temperature hovers on the brink of change, freezing all longing and anticipation into a single flower on the screen.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, a Song dynasty painter later created 'The Already Cool Painting' based on this poem, deliberately including a delicate feminine hand peeking from behind the screen beside the broken branches. This sparked endless debates among later generations about 'who exactly was behind the screen.'

Suddenly, a gust of wind swept up scattered drafts, and Old Du murmured, 'The clouds and rain of Gaotang you described—can even the ruins of the Chu palace be found now?'

King Xiang eagerly asked, 'What did the goddess look like?' Song Yu unrolled a bamboo scroll: 'When she first appeared, her radiance was like the rising sun illuminating the roof beams...'

The north wind swept up yellow sand, and he seemed to see Zhaojun's red skirt vanishing beyond the palace gates, leaving only her lonely green mound in the desert facing the setting sun.

      "meaning": "In the spring night's garden, Li Bai, clutching a wine jar, slumped beneath a peach tree as petals showered onto his robe. With drunken eyes, he raised his cup: 'Brother Moon, Brother Shadow, tonight the three of us shall not part until we're thoroughly drunk!' The moon hung silently on the branch, while his shadow swayed on the stone steps. Suddenly, he rose and danced, sleeves fluttering, startling roosting birds and scattering petals with his sash. Before collapsing in drunkenness, he shouted to the Milky Way: 'We shall meet again in the celestial river!'",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that during Li Bai's tenure as a Hanlin scholar in Chang'an, he often scaled walls to drink in the imperial garden at midnight. One night, he smuggled in a jar of Western Region grape wine and sneaked into the peony garden, only to encounter guards patrolling with torches. Hiding hastily behind a rockery, the moonlight cast his shadow onto a Taihu stone. 'One, two, three...' He suddenly burst into laughter, startling the guards who shouted: 'Who goes there!' Li Bai stumbled out, swaying his wine jar: 'Fear not, the three of us are composing poetry together!'",
      "background": "In the spring of the third year of Tianbao, Li Bai, having been dismissed with a golden handout, lodged at a friend's house in Luoyang. That night, upon hearing of Emperor Xuanzong and Lady Yang feasting at Mount Li, he smashed his zither in fury. Suddenly noticing the moonlight streaming through the window like silk, he grabbed his wine jar and rushed into the backyard, singing wildly toward Chang'an: 'You have your Rainbow and Feather Garment Dance, but I have the moon and my shadow as companions!' With that, he flung half the jar's wine at the moon, the droplets glinting like shards of silver in the moonlight.",
      "additional_info": "The Song Dynasty painting academy once used this poem as a subject for artists. The winning entry was a painting titled 'Three Companions': Li Bai toasts the moon, but his shadow is depicted as two figures—one in official robes representing unfulfilled ambitions, the other with a sword symbolizing his knight-errant ideals. Even more ingenious was the faint image of Chang'e in the moon raising her cup in response, subtly echoing the poem's 'distant Milky Way' imagery.",

Moonlight pierced the iron bars, and he suddenly sat up, murmuring: 'The moon over Fuzhou must be just as bright...' Before him rose the image of his wife, Lady Yang, leaning alone by the window—her cloud-like hair damp with night mist, her jade arms bathed in the cold glow, gazing at the moon in longing. Their young children tugged playfully at her sleeves, unaware of why their mother wept. The poet clutched his prison garb, as if already seeing their future reunion—moonlight illuminating the tearstains on both their faces.",

Du Fu fled with his family but was captured by the rebels and taken back to the city. One autumn night, the jailer Old Zhao brought him food and noticed Du Fu staring blankly at the moon. \"Deputy Censor Du, missing home again?\" he asked. Du Fu smiled bitterly. \"Old Zhao, do you think this moonlight also shines upon my wife and children in Fuzhou right now?\" Suddenly, he seized a piece of charcoal and scrawled on the wall, \"Her fragrant curls damp with mist\"—for he imagined his wife standing so long under the moon that the night dew had soaked her hair.",
      "background": "In the damp prison cell, crickets chirped in the corner. Du Fu handed the last half of a hard biscuit to the young prisoner next door, listening as the man spoke of the war near Fuzhou. Suddenly, the laughter of children drifted past the walls.

Clutching the letter from home against his chest—marked with his wife’s secret sign in eyebrow pencil—he heard the night watchman announce the hour: the very moment he had admired peonies with her three years ago. The moonlight turned piercingly bright. He turned and carved the words \"when will tears dry in our shared reflection\" into the wall with his fingernail.",

One day, Xiangru played a qin made of Shu's tung wood, while Wenjun accompanied him with a zither from Zhao—their harmonious duet became legendary. When Li Bai alluded to this tale, however, the phoenix pegs and paired strings became symbols of solitude—Zhuo Wenjun, once the woman with 'eyes like rippling waves,' was now a lovelorn wife whose 'tears flowed like a spring.'",

      "meaning": "By the Pavilion of Aloeswood, peonies and the Noble Consort radiate mutual splendor, while Emperor Xuanzong leans against the railing, gazing with a tender smile. As the spring breeze drifts by, even the sovereign's usual cares dissolve—in this moment, the famed flowers whisper secrets, the beauty is a living painting, and the swirling grain of the aloeswood railing etches the most enchanting scene of the High Tang's golden age.",
      "allusion": "In the spring of the second year of Tianbao, Emperor Xuanzong ordered peonies to be transplanted to the Pavilion of Sinking Fragrance. As Lady Yang's drunken cheeks flushed crimson, Li Bai was summoned to compose poetry. Just as the musician Li Guinian was about to sing, the emperor suddenly raised his hand: 'Hold! First transcribe Li Bai's verses onto golden-flowered paper before performing.' Princess Yuzhen discreetly tugged Li Bai's sleeve and whispered: 'For the third poem, you must leave the line \"interpreting the spring breeze\" for my amusement.'",
      "background": "As Li Bai took up his brush, willow catkins drifted outside the pavilion. Watching the imperial consort's embroidered robe sweep fallen petals from the desk, he suddenly recalled Gao Lishi's petty obstruction the day before. With a twist of his brush, he wrote, \"Dispelling spring's boundless regrets\"—simultaneously depicting the emperor's melancholy while subtly satirizing the eunuch's power play. Tossing the brush aside with a laugh, he startled the azure phoenix roosting at the pavilion's corner.",
      "additional_info": "Later generations discovered that the three \"Qing Ping Diao\" poems subtly aligned with musical rhythms: the first suited the beat of a war drum, the second the melody of a jade flute, and the third the strumming of an ancient zither. During the Song Dynasty, a musician attempted to reconstruct the tunes, but as he played the line \"north of the Chenxiang Pavilion,\" the zither strings suddenly snapped—legend claims it was Emperor Xuanzong manifesting his spirit.",

      "meaning": "The autumn night was slightly chilly, with a crescent moon hanging like a hook. A noblewoman of Chang'an sat alone in her chamber, her fingers lingering over the silver zither. 'Dang—' The note echoed through the empty courtyard. She glanced down at her thin silk robe but refused to call her maid for warmer clothes. 'One more tune...' she murmured to herself, though in truth, she dared not turn to face the cold, intricately carved bed behind her.",
      "allusion": "This evokes the autumn nights of the Han palace: when Ban Jieyu was left alone in the Changxin Palace, she once compared a round fan to 'autumn's arrival, love's departure.' That night, she too played the zither until midnight. An elderly palace maid urged her, 'My lady, the dew grows heavy.' But she only gazed toward the Weiyang Palace with a bitter smile and asked, 'Does the shadow of the osmanthus tree not resemble the brows the Emperor painted for me last year?'",
      "background": "When Wang Ya served as a Hanlin scholar, he often kept night watch in the palace. On one frosty evening, he saw palace maids filing out of the Linde Hall with musical instruments, all except one musician in a pale purple robe who lingered at the end. Suddenly, she turned back to glance at the brightly lit hall, and her silhouette reminded the poet of his wife far away in Luoyang.",
      "additional_info": "Tang noblewomen often considered 'fearing an empty chamber' an elegant sentiment. At the time, 'night zither gatherings' were in vogue: wives would deliberately hold zither competitions when their husbands were on night duty, though in truth, it was an excuse to stay up late and share intimate conversations.",

      "meaning": "In the early morning, the rain washed away the dust from Weicheng, and by the green-brick inn, tender willow buds sprouted, brimming with the vitality of spring. The poet and his friend held hands, gazing at each other, their wine cups clinking and spilling drops of amber light: 'Drink one more cup—once you pass Yangguan, you’ll seldom meet old friends again.' The drizzle dampened the sleeves of the parting travelers, and willow branches traced arcs of reluctance in the wind.",
      "allusion": "The painter Wu Daozi once saw Wang Wei composing a poem in a tavern. As Wang dipped his brush in wine to write the characters 'Weicheng' on the wooden table, a flower seller passed by outside, the willow branches in her basket brushing against the inkstone, staining the paper with verdant hues. Wang Wei laughed: 'Heaven has gifted us the color of willows!' and promptly added the line 'so fresh and green.' Later, this painting was bought by a merchant from the Western Regions and reportedly hung beyond Yangguan for thirty years.",
      "background": "On the day Wang Wei bid farewell to Yuan Er, who was departing for Anxi, he awoke to find the farewell poem he had prepared the night before marred by a cat’s ink-stained paw prints. As he hastily rewrote it, he heard the neighing of post horses outside—Yuan Er had already fastened his luggage. The poet grabbed the half-dry paper and rushed out, tucking it into the luggage under the rain-dampened willow tree: 'Take some of Chang’an’s spring with you.'",
      "additional_info": "The Dunhuang Library Cave yielded a Tang Dynasty musical score titled 'Three Refrains of Yangguan,' composed by court musicians. Scholars discovered the original melody required the line 'I urge you to drink one more cup of wine' to be sung three times—because during the High Tang era, farewells truly involved three consecutive toasts: one to the homeland, one to the journey ahead, and one to reunion.",

      "meaning": "The cold rain before Qingming dampened the lush grass, while the spring breeze swept across the wheat fields, and tender green willow branches gently brushed the riverbank. A wanderer gazed at the spring scenery, yet the chaos of war prevented him from returning home. Just then, a cuckoo bird cried 'better go home' in his ear. He smiled bitterly and said to the bird, 'Stop calling. Don’t you think I long to return?'",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that Emperor Du Yu of Shu transformed into a cuckoo bird after his death. Every spring, it cries day and night until its mouth bleeds. The Tang Dynasty poet Li Shangyin once wrote, 'The spring heart of Emperor Du Yu is entrusted to the cuckoo.' In Jiangnan, people interpret the cuckoo's call as 'better go home,' making it a symbol of a wanderer’s longing for home.",
      "background": "During the An Lushan Rebellion, a scholar from Jiangnan was stranded in the north. Before the Cold Food Festival, he stood on a rural ridge as the drizzle soaked his blue robe. In the distance, farmers were preparing for Qingming tomb-sweeping, reminding him of his ancestral graves back home. Suddenly, a cuckoo’s cry pierced through the rain. He clenched his fists tightly, his nails digging deep into his palms.",
      "additional_info": "Ancient Chinese believed that the cuckoo’s blood-stained cries dyed the azaleas red in the mountains, hence their alternate name 'mountain red.' Li Bai once connected the two in his verse: 'In Shu, I heard the cuckoo’s cry; in Xuancheng, I see the azalea bloom.' Even today, azaleas remain a symbol of homesickness.",

His fingertips trembled, as if through the snow-blown station he could see the plum tree his mother had planted years ago. This was no mere inquiry about flowers; it was a dread of hearing the answer 'The plum tree withered long ago,' which would lay bare his guilt for not returning home in ten years.",
      "allusion": "The Southern Dynasty poet Lu Kai once broke off a plum branch to send to a friend, attaching a poem: 'In Jiangnan, I have nothing to offer but this branch of spring.' The story goes that the courier galloped three hundred miles, and when the friend opened the silk pouch, the ice crystals on the plum petals had just melted—like the tears of a wanderer. When Wang Wei alluded to this典故, he lacked even the courage to send a plum branch—he feared his hometown was no longer as he remembered.",
      "background": "This scene depicts Wang Wei secretly entrusting someone to inquire about his hometown after being forced to serve under the rebel regime during the An Lushan Rebellion. Historical records note that he would burn incense and sit alone daily, with a preserved plum branch from his Wangchuan estate always on his desk. When the townsman finally appeared, he dared only to ask about the most trivial thing—the plum blossoms—as if afraid to touch a festering wound.",
      "additional_info": "Later generations discovered that Wang Wei had indeed planted vermilion plums at his Wangchuan villa. These plums exude a red sap when blooming, resembling tears of blood. Remarkably, modern botanists have verified that this variety's lifespan is precisely thirty years—exactly matching the time from Wang Wei's departure from home to his death.",

      "meaning": "On a spring night in Chang'an City, the young woman Ayun leaned against the carved window lattice, gazing at the same bright moon. Her fingers caressed the jade hairpin her husband had given her before his departure when suddenly, she heard the night watchman strike the third watch. A thousand miles away at the frontier fortress of Huanglong, her husband, Captain Wang, was polishing his spear, its tip gleaming under the moonlight. The poet intertwines the imagery of 'the chamber moon' and 'the Han army camp,' transforming moonlight into a messenger of longing that traverses the flames of war.",
      "allusion": "The allusion to Dragon City originates from the legendary Han Dynasty general Li Guang. In the winter of the second year of Yuanshou, Li Guang led his troops through Yanmen Pass but lost his way in a blizzard. When the golden tent of the Xiongnu chieftain suddenly appeared, the old general, his white beard frozen with ice, still drew his bow and shouted, 'This arrow shall take Dragon City!' The arrow pierced three layers of leather tents, terrifying the chieftain into retreating thirty miles overnight. This heroic act, embodying 'though unattainable, the heart yearns for it,' became a spiritual emblem for later generations of soldiers.",
      "background": "While on night duty at the Ministry of War, Shen Quanqi overheard an old patrolling soldier humming a hometown folk tune. The soldier's bronze armor glimmered faintly under the lantern light when he suddenly mentioned how his wife always gazed at the moon by the washing stone. The poet glanced at the pile of military reports on his desk, and the still-wet ink of the phrase 'years of unending war' suddenly stung his eyes. With a shift of his brush, he wrote 'the young wife's spring longing,' the vermilion ink in the stone mortar dissolving like blood of相思 (longing).",
      "additional_info": "Tang Dynasty poems of boudoir lament often used 'clothes pounding' as an image, but Shen Quanqi ingeniously contrasted 'the chamber moon' with 'the camp moon.' According to 'Records of the Kaiyuan and Tianbao Eras,' Emperor Xuanzong once set this poem to music. During rehearsals by palace maids, a maid named Niannu wept uncontrollably upon singing the line 'my beloved's tenderness last night'—her elder brother was stationed at the Anxi Protectorate.",

      "meaning": "In the autumn prison cell, the cicadas' chirping pierced Luo Binwang's eardrums. The poet, wearing a prisoner's southern cap, gazed at the dark cicada wings outside the iron window, contrasting with his own white hair, and recalled the lament of loyalty in the Han-era folk song 'Song of White Hair.' The dew dampened the cicada's wings, making it difficult to fly high, just as court slander blocked the path of loyal ministers' remonstrance. Dipping his brush in moonlight, he wrote on the wall: 'The world sees only the cicada's purity in drinking dew, but who understands this heart of ice?'",
      "allusion": "During the Western Han Dynasty, Zhuo Wenjun, upon hearing her husband Sima Xiangru's intention to take a concubine, wrote the grief-stricken 'Song of White Hair': 'Pure as mountain snow, bright as clouds' moon. Hearing you have two hearts, I come to sever ties.' She placed the poem and a lock of white hair in a brocade pouch. When Sima Xiangru opened it, he was overcome with shame and ultimately reconciled with his wife. In prison, Luo Binwang saw the cicada and likened himself to this strand of 'white hair,' symbolizing the desolation of a loyal minister cast aside.",
      "background": "In the autumn of the third year of the Yifeng era, a chill seeped through the cracks of the Imperial Censorate's prison bricks. Luo Binwang, accused of 'corruption' for submitting a remonstrance, was abruptly awakened by the sound of cicadas. Stumbling to the window, he saw an autumn cicada perched on the iron bars, its transparent wings trembling as dewdrops rolled off. 'Are you trapped here too?' The poet's trembling fingers brushed his own streaked white hair before he suddenly grabbed a piece of charcoal and frantically inscribed a poem on the mottled wall. As the jailer's footsteps drew near, the final character 'heart' in the line 'Who will speak my heart?' trailed off into a long mark, like an un dried bloodstain.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, at age seven, Luo Binwang wrote 'White feathers float on green water' in his 'Ode to the Goose,' but fifty years later, his 'Ode to the Cicada' became a 'Song of White Hair.'

With the boatman's shout, the light vessel shot downstream like an arrow from a bow. The cries of gibbons on both banks still echoed through the valley, yet in the blink of an eye, countless green mountains were left behind. The poet clapped his hands and laughed: 'These Yangtze waters are even swifter than my drunken exhilaration!'",
      "allusion": "In the second year of the Qianyuan era under Emperor Suzong of Tang, Li Bai was exiled to Yelang due to his involvement in the Prince Yong case. As his boat reached White Emperor City, news of a pardon suddenly arrived. The old boatman watched as this banished immortal suddenly threw his head back in laughter, tucked the imperial edict into his robe, and declared: 'Turn the boat around! To Jiangling!' The escorting officers stared in astonishment as he seized a wineskin, drank deeply, and then composed this poem at the prow.",

The north wind howled across the river, lifting Meng Haoran's robes. Gazing at the vast waters, he suddenly thought of his home by the Xiang River—now surely shrouded in the smoke of evening cooking fires. But before him lay only the misty clouds of Chu. A tear struck the boat's gunwale; as he raised his hand to wipe it away, he found his sleeve already soaked with homesick tears. On the horizon, a lone sail slowly vanished where water met clouds, mirroring his own rootless existence.",
      "allusion": "The line 'lost at the ford, I long to ask' subtly alludes to a典故 from the Analects: When Confucius traveled among the states, he met the recluses Chang Ju and Jie Ni at a ferry crossing. When Zilu asked for directions, the hermits replied, 'The world is as turbulent as a flood—who can change it?' This detail is adapted by Meng Haoran. Standing by the river, he mirrors Confucius a millennium earlier, both filled with uncertainty facing life's vast unknowns.",

The accent pierced his heart. Hurrying toward the ferry, he found the last boat already three zhang from shore. The vendor called after him, 'Come back tomorrow, young master!' But gazing at the darkening sky, Meng murmured, 'Tomorrow... where should I go then?'",

Gazing up, he saw early-returning geese skimming across the Milky Way, while tree shadows remained dense in the dawn light, and distant mountains stood sharply defined against the clear sky. A fallen leaf drifted from Huainan, and suddenly, the poet felt the passage of time, realizing he had grown as aged as the misty waves.",
      "allusion": "The line 'a leaf falls from Huainan' subtly alludes to a典故 from 'Huainanzi': During the Western Han Dynasty, a retainer of Prince Liu An of Huainan sighed upon seeing a fallen leaf, 'The fall of a single leaf heralds the autumn of the world.' Legend has it that Liu An was discussing philosophy with his retainers in the courtyard when a yellow leaf drifted down.

He flung open the window, and a cold wind rushed in, scattering fallen leaves. The candle flame swayed violently, splashing scalding wax onto the back of his hand.",
      "additional_info": "The Song Dynasty poet Yan Jidao once jested: 'Du Mu's candle has burned through the eyes of all who part.'

      "meaning": "The spring breeze brushed over the stone-paved roads of Yangzhou as the thirteen-year-old songstress lifted the beaded curtain of the painted boat. Du Mu reined in his horse and watched the graceful maiden stand there, the cardamom flowers in her hair trembling lightly in the wind. 'The spring scenery of the ten-mile-long street pales in comparison to your fleeting glance when you raised the curtain,' the poet thought, wrapping the reins around his palm three times, yet ultimately not daring to approach her.",
      "allusion": "The allusion to cardamom originates from a Lingnan folktale: a young maiden named A-Kou rescued an injured white deer while gathering herbs, and the divine deer gifted her a pair of miraculous twin flowers. When in bloom, the flowers resembled two maidens standing side by side—the left petal like a thirteen-year-old still carrying childish innocence, the right petal like a fifteen-year-old just beginning to reveal her charm. A young herbalist exclaimed, 'This flower shall be named cardamom,' and thus it became a symbol of a maiden's youthful years.",
      "background": "While serving as the secretary in Yangzhou, Du Mu often composed poems in the taverns by the Slender West Lake. One day, slightly intoxicated, he rode back to his residence when the fragmented notes of a pipa suddenly caught his ear. Looking up, he happened to see the young songstress returning from her music lesson. The way she tiptoed to pluck a willow branch reminded him of his younger sister in Chang'an, who had just turned thirteen, and a drop of ink from his brush stained his blue robe.",
      "additional_info": "The Song Dynasty poet Jiang Kui once made a special trip to visit the 'ten-mile spring breeze road' described in the poem, only to discover that the scene Du Mu depicted was actually Yangzhou's narrowest winding alley—proof that in the eyes of one smitten, even a three-foot alley can transform into a ten-mile boulevard bathed in spring breeze.",

A palace maiden leaned against the window, her beautiful eyes fixed solely on the swallow's nest beneath the eaves—where pairs of swallows dwelled. Suddenly, the lamplight flickered, and she hastily plucked a jade hairpin from her hair, gently nudging aside the spark that burst from the wick to save a moth drawn to the flame. This subtle gesture betrayed her longing for freedom and her compassion for life.",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that during Emperor Xuanzong's reign of the Tang Dynasty, there was a palace maiden named Jiang Caiping who was skilled at taming white parrots. One day, a parrot accidentally touched a candle flame, and she rushed to extinguish it with her bare hands, heedless of the burns. Upon learning of this, Emperor Xuanzong sighed, 'Even birds know gratitude—how much more should humans?' This tale spread widely among the palace maidens, and the maiden's act of saving the moth in the poem may well have been inspired by it.",
      "background": "While staying overnight at a friend's residence, the poet Zhang Hu suddenly heard faint sighs from the neighboring palace. Peering through the latticed window, he saw, in the flickering candlelight, a slender figure gazing wistfully at the swallow's nest.

Struck by the poignant scene, the poet immediately recorded it on a sheet of Xue Tao paper he carried with him.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Tang Dynasty palace maidens often wore hair ornaments shaped like swallows, crafted from gold or silver, known as 'swallow hairpins.' The poet deliberately chose the image of a 'jade hairpin,' blending realism with the metaphorical implication that 'she is less free than the swallows.' Later, Li Shangyin's allusion to 'jade swallows on hairpins' may well have originated from such courtly customs.",

      "meaning": "On a morning in early February, the poet Qian Qi stood outside the Forbidden City, watching orioles flit past the upturned eaves of the Shanglin Garden. The willows by the Dragon Pool appeared even more verdant in the drizzle, while the bells of the Changle Palace faded gradually through the blossoms. Stroking his graying temples, he thought of the past decade spent submitting literary compositions in vain pursuit of official recognition, and couldn't help but feel ashamed before the splendid official cap of Attendant Pei. The line 'Spring's warmth cannot dispel the regret of a dead end' perfectly captured his frustration at remaining unrecognized despite the season's vitality.",
      "allusion": "The phrase 'ten years of submitting compositions' alludes to the story of Sima Xiangru from the Han Dynasty. When Emperor Wu of Han read Xiangru's 'Rhapsody of Sir Vacuous' composed at the Liang Garden, he exclaimed: 'Why couldn't I have been born in the same era as this man!' Upon learning the author was still alive, he immediately summoned him to court. Xiangru then presented 'Rhapsody on the Imperial Park' and finally gained prominence. This典故 illustrates the arduous path ancient scholars took to seek office through literary submissions.",
      "background": "On a rainy day during the Tianbao era's tenth year, the 46-year-old Qian Qi waited once more outside the palace gates for an audience. Watching young Attendant Pei hurry into the palace holding an oil-paper umbrella, he felt raindrops trickling down his own worn robe. The lofty aspirations he'd harbored when first submitting compositions a decade ago had now dissolved into the rain-soaked scroll in his hands. Distant bell tolls reminded him of his wife and children waiting at home for rice, and his verses flowed forth mingled with the briny taste of rainwater.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, Qian Qi later composed the immortal lines 'When the song ends, no one is in sight; On the river, a few green peaks remain' in his examination poem 'Goddess of the Xiang River Playing Zither', finally earning the jinshi degree in Tianbao 10.

After ten rounds of wine, Du Fu gazed at the dark mountain shadows outside the window—tomorrow's parting might well be their last.",

Like Du Fu and Wei Ba's reunion tonight, they were inseparable friends in their youth in Chang'an, but war scattered them, making their meetings as rare as these celestial bodies crossing paths.",

      "allusion": "This story originates from the Han-era folk ballad 'Mulberry by the Path': the beautiful Luofu, while gathering mulberry leaves, caught the attention of a governor who halted his carriage to proposition her: 'Would you care to ride with me?' Luofu cleverly replied, 'My lord, you have your wife, and I have my husband,' then boasted of her (fictional) husband's exceptional talent and looks, shaming the governor into retreat. When Li Bai adapted this allusion, he had Luofu tactfully decline with the excuse of 'hungry silkworms,' making her appear even more lively and endearing.",
      "background": "During the Tianbao era, Li Bai served as an imperial academician in Chang'an. One spring afternoon, observing palace maids picking mulberry leaves together, he suddenly recalled the mulberry gatherers of his hometown. In his wine-induced haze, he imagined the Han-dynasty Luofu stepping across time itself. Seized by inspiration, he brushed this fresh, lyrical poem onto paper. As he penned the final line, ink splattered across the page. Chuckling, he told his attendant, 'Look—even the ink rushes to chase after Lady Luofu!'",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, according to the Jin-dynasty 'Notes on Past and Present,' Luofu was actually from Handan in the state of Zhao, earning her name through her skilled performances of 'Mulberry by the Path.' By the Tang dynasty, poets universally reimagined her as a maiden of Qin. Lu Guimeng even wrote, 'Sing not the old 'Mulberry by the Path'—none now know Qin's Luofu.'",
      "questions": [
        "How did Luofu cleverly reject the governor?",
        "How significant was mulberry gathering in the Tang dynasty?",
        "Why did Li Bai enjoy writing about women?"

      "meaning": "On an autumn night in Chang'an, the watery moonlight cascaded over the rooftops of countless households. Women took advantage of the moonlight to pound clothes, the rhythmic sound of wooden mallets striking fabric echoing through the air. In the rustling autumn wind, they longed for their husbands, far away at the Yumen Pass on the frontier. 'No matter how this wind blows, it cannot scatter my sorrow!' murmured a young woman, pausing her mallet to gaze at the moon. She yearned for the border conflicts to end soon, so her husband could return from the endless campaign.",
      "allusion": "Legend has it that during Emperor Xuanzong's reign, border wars were frequent. In the western market of Chang'an, there lived a woman named Lady Wang, whose husband had been stationed at the frontier for three years without returning. Every autumn night, she would pound clothes by moonlight, hammering her longing for her husband into the fabric. Her neighbor, Aunt Li, advised her, 'Don't overwork yourself, dear.' But she replied, 'The sound of my pounding will carry all the way to Yumen Pass, letting my beloved know I await him.' Later, Li Bai heard of this and penned this poem in response.",
      "background": "On an autumn night in the third year of the Tianbao era, Li Bai sat alone in a Chang'an tavern, sipping wine. Outside, the rhythmic pounding of clothes reminded him of the conscription notices he had seen earlier that day on Zhuque Avenue. 'War again...' He drained his cup, visions of bloodied soldiers on the frontier and the countless wives in Chang'an gazing anxiously into the distance flooding his mind. Moonlight streamed through the window lattice as he seized his brush and, on wine-stained paper, wrote this deeply moving 'Autumn Song.'",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, in the Tang Dynasty, 'pounding clothes' referred to beating already-woven fabric with mallets to soften it for tailoring—distinct from the modern concept of 'laundry.' Li Bai deliberately chose this detail, blending realism with poetic beauty, allowing us a millennium later to still hear the timeless sound of longing echoing across the ages.",
      "questions": [
        "What exactly did 'pounding clothes' entail in the Tang Dynasty?",
        "Where is Yumen Pass located today?",
        "Why was Li Bai so concerned with the wives of soldiers?"

      "meaning": "On the Mid-Autumn night with moonlight like water, Bai Juyi sat alone by the broken window of a post station. He gazed at the fragmented letters from home—his eldest brother from Fuliang spoke of soaring rice prices, his seventh brother from Yuqian mentioned farmlands destroyed by war, and the letter from his fifteenth brother from Wujiang still bore mud stains from their flight as refugees. Suddenly, a flock of southbound geese swept across the moon. The poet stood abruptly, knocking over his teacup: 'Are we brothers not like these scattered geese? Even the moonlight shining on our five hometowns has turned into the same glimmer of tears.'",
      "allusion": "The poet recalled the allusion of 'autumn tumbleweeds': When Confucius traveled through the states, he saw wild tumbleweeds rolling in the wind and sighed to Zilu, 'Human life is like these tumbleweeds, never finding its proper place!' At that moment, outside the post station, dried tumbleweeds brushed against the stone steps, rustling as if echoing that millennia-old lament.",
      "background": "In the winter of the 15th year of Zhenyuan, Bai Juyi was escorting disaster relief grain through Xinzheng. On a snowy night, he huddled beside the grain cart and heard refugees humming a childhood song from their homeland. Suddenly, a courier exclaimed, 'Sir, the messenger from Fuli has frozen to death on the road!' Trembling, he pried open the tightly clutched letter from the deceased, which bore four charcoal-written words from his younger brother: 'Sister has starved to death.' Outside the window, the moon shone like frost, illuminating his trembling wrist as he wrote poetry through the night.",
      "additional_info": "The original manuscript of this poem is preserved in the Kyoto Museum in Japan. At the end of the scroll, a Northern Song collector noted: 'The ink strokes in Bai Gong’s poem vary in depth, particularly the phrase \"scattered flesh and blood,\" which pierces the paper—likely from tears falling onto the parchment as he wrote.'",

        "What do tumbleweeds symbolize?",
        "What emotion do the geese represent?",
        "Why choose the moon as a focal point for expressing emotions?"

      "meaning": "As the setting sun dyed the river crimson, the poet Liu Changqing stood at the head of Parrot Islet, gazing at the calm waters devoid of waves or mist. He thought of his exiled friend, Imperial Censor Yuan, his longing as ethereal as the river haze. In the distance, birds flew obliquely across the sunset-lit Hankou, while the autumn waters of Dongting Lake merged with the horizon. Suddenly, a solitary city's horn sounded in the cold wind, as riverside sentries moored for the night. This scene reminded him of the past when Jia Yi, out of concern for the nation, submitted memorials only to be exiled to Changsha—how similar were the fates of loyal ministers across time!",
      "allusion": "During Emperor Wen of Han's reign, the young prodigy Jia Yi spoke fervently in the Xuan Shi Hall: 'Your Majesty, the feudal lords grow too powerful; their fiefs must be reduced to secure the Han dynasty!' The emperor nodded in agreement, yet due to slander from powerful officials, Jia Yi was demoted to Tutor of the Prince of Changsha. On the day of his departure, Jia Yi gazed at the vermilion walls of the Weiyang Palace and said bitterly to his students, 'My path mirrors Qu Yuan's—the southern tangerine becomes trifoliate orange beyond the Huai.' During his three years in Changsha, he wrote 'Lament for Qu Yuan' and ultimately died of melancholy.",
      "background": "One autumn dusk, Liu Changqing, newly demoted to the post of Assistant Transport Commissioner of E-Yue, wandered alone by the river. He looked toward Yueyang across the waters—where his similarly exiled friend, Imperial Censor Yuan, resided. The river wind whipped his robes, and the distant sentries' horns reminded him of his own demotion a decade prior for his unyielding integrity. Suddenly, he seized a flat stone from the shore and hurled it into the river's heart: 'The pain of Jia Yi lingers still!' The stone skipped seven times across the water, mirroring the seven parts indignation and three parts sorrow in his heart.",
      "additional_info": "Interestingly, the word 'obliquely' (斜) in the line 'birds flew obliquely across the sunset-lit Hankou' was the result of Liu Changqing's meticulous refinement. Legend has it he first wrote 'fly,' then changed it to 'traverse,' before finally settling on 'obliquely' upon witnessing an egret skimming diagonally over the water. This character not only captures the birds' flight path but also subtly conveys the 'askew' nature of human fate.",
      "questions": [
        "Why was Jia Yi exiled to Changsha?",
        "What is the brilliance of the word 'obliquely' in the poem?",
        "Who was Imperial Censor Yuan?"
